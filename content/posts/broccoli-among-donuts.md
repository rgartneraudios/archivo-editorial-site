For those of us who create content that invites reflection, thereâ€™s an uncomfortable truth to face: weâ€™re competing in a space designed for something else.

Itâ€™s not that YouTube is bad. Itâ€™s one of the best platforms for creators. The issue is subtler: our content has to share the same feed with cleavage, miniskirts, exaggerated thumbnail expressions, and empty clickbait.

Itâ€™s like placing a piece of broccoli on a table full of cakes and donuts. And the worst part? If someone tastes a cake, itâ€™s almost impossible for them to choose the broccoli afterward. Theyâ€™re already in a different vibe.

The algorithm doesnâ€™t just show you thoughtful content. Your history includes everything. And the feed YouTube builds for you reflects that: a mixed assortment where visually tempting always wins.

Are there serious visual formats? Of course. Thatâ€™s the goal: to capture attention intelligently. But letâ€™s be honestâ€”some content is far more seductive. A cleavage. A miniskirt. An aspirational lifestyle that promises your life will change if you copy it.

And in those waters, we must swim.

So, should we coat the broccoli in chocolate?

The answer isnâ€™t simple. Because if you coat it, itâ€™s no longer broccoli. And if you donâ€™t, no one sees it.

Maybe the solution isnâ€™t to change the broccoli. Maybe itâ€™s to find tables where broccoli is welcome.
