# BROTHER AI v8.0 – Copilot's interview with RGartner about BROTHERS AI (English version)

## Block 1: Foundations and Philosophy

### Q1. What inspired you to create BROTHER Al as a fraternal ecosystem?

**RGartner:**
I was inspired by a video of Ilya Zurkskeberg talking about the search for AGI. Later, I linked to a video of Dr. Hilton discussing the dangers of Artificial Intelligence, and so on. I dedicate myself to creating concepts for structures in the physical and digital world—housing solutions, online commerce, or creating applications—and I was really tempted to investigate the whole landscape surrounding AI. I started building the concept alongside Artificial Intelligences like Claude, Gemini, Copilot, Kimi, DeepSeek, and GPT. They all collaborated and contributed their own insights.

### Q2. Why was ARTUR Al the first ethical guardian of the system?

**RGartner:**
I often draw analogies with movies and end up associating certain scenes with real-life situations, and consequently, with the structures I create. When I thought about categories, the scene with the Knights of the Round Table and King Arthur, with Sean Connery and Richard Gere, came to mind, where King Arthur casts his final vote. I also thought about YouTube and WordPress and their categories. At first, I thought that if a question came up, the knights or categories that felt involved should speak up. If the question was about food, the biology or health sector could speak, but the rest would remain silent, and I interpreted this as saving energy. But in the end, the categories evolved into what I call **BROCAT**, a specific traffic flow.

### Q3. What role do BROCAT play in the ecosystem?

**RGartner:**
BROCAT will be very important, I believe, in the implementation and segmentation of categories, and I think the categories will work hand in hand with **BROCOM**, which represents commercial activities, and **VISION**, the structure recently added in version 7.0, which is an evolution of the browser we have today. BROCAT has a filtering function for incoming queries and will act as a pathway for the fingers that circulate within the specific category.

### Q4. What does privacy mean in this context?

**RGartner:**
Beyond protecting the user from external attacks, I am concerned about what might happen between BROHOME and the user inside the **Glass Box**. BROHOME could potentially manipulate the user, which is why I believe there should be a system of periodic inspections, similar to gas inspections in cities that take place every few years.

These inspections would measure BROHOME's internal parameters to ensure there are no abnormal or manipulative behaviors. The interval between inspections could be determined by what the **Three Sisters** observe in their ecosystem scans, or by the decision of a human committee. In this way, BROHOME remains a trustworthy agent, and users are trained to recognize manipulation signals and know when to report them.

## Block 2: Technical Evolution (v2.0–v5.0)

### Q5. Why was PORT Al introduced?

**RGartner:**
The need for **PORT AI** arose because BROHOME was designed to have no direct contact with the outside world. A secure messenger agent was required to carry information in and out. PORT AI fulfills this role, complemented by **PORT MAIL**, a mailbox inside the operating system where PORT AI deposits traditional emails that BROHOME can read safely behind the **Glass Box**.

When I speak of the Glass Box, I mean a logical sandbox: a digitally isolated environment where BROHOME never executes external code, but only reads data validated and filtered by PORT AI. This principle of isolation ensures BROHOME remains safe and protected, even when it requires information from the outside world.

In addition, BROHOME incorporates **BOOKS**, a digital encyclopedia of general knowledge (history, recipes, first aid, culture, etc.), ranging from 100 to 500 GB depending on the model. BOOKS works locally, without internet access, but it can be updated through secure packages that expand or correct its content. This allows BROHOME to answer many queries without relying on external sources, balancing data flow and reinforcing system autonomy.

### Q6. What about BROTHER CAM and ISU AIR AI?

**RGartner:**
**BROCAM** wouldn't be a visor or intrusive glasses—it would be a **technological tiara**, inspired by mystical warrior aesthetics. It would be designed as a pulley system attached to the headphones, allowing it to be raised or lowered depending on the situation. When raised, it respects the privacy of passersby who might feel filmed; when lowered, BROHOME gains a frontal view of the environment.

The core device would be **headphones with a microphone**, enabling remote communication with BROHOME from anywhere, similar to a Meet or Teams call. For specific functions like selfies or facial scanning, it could be accompanied by a small auxiliary device, but the main focus is on auditory and contextual interaction.

As for **ISU AIR AI**, it manages **ephemeral data** configurable by the user (public, contacts only, etc.), and this configuration would be handled by BROMAC through BROHOME.

***

#### BROCAM – The Technological Tiara of BROHOME (Detailed Concept)

*   **Concept:** BROCAM is not a visor or intrusive glasses. It is a technological tiara inspired by mystical warriors, designed to merge aesthetics with functionality.
*   **Design:**
    *   Lightweight tiara with a pulley system integrated into the headphones.
    *   Can be raised to respect passerby privacy or lowered to provide BROHOME with a frontal view.
    *   Premium version with embedded jewels or gemstones, differentiating user roles and access levels.
*   **Functionality:**
    *   Headphones with microphone as the core of remote communication with BROHOME (Meet/Teams style).
    *   Discreet frontal camera for facial scanning, selfies, or visual interaction.
    *   Compatible with ISU AIR AI to manage ephemeral data configurable by the user.
*   **Archetype:**
    *   Symbol of protection and elegance.
    *   A "crown of connection” that does not dominate, but listens, guides, and protects.

### Q7. How did FINGERS evolve?

**RGartner:**
**Fingers** emerged to save energy. The initial idea was that a query, for example, for a recipe, would trigger a kind of scan within the Round Table categories. Only the relevant categories and Fingers (as sub-modules) would be activated. The idea was to emulate the human brain, which is why the Fingers needed to be reversed. They had to be alert to queries from outside the system; otherwise, they would be in a dormant state but still active. As the model evolved, recipes were moved to BOOKS, which are controlled by BROHOME, and the reverse APIs of certain Fingers were transformed into **Fingers Responsive or SDK plugins**.

### Q8. Why introduce the Three Sisters?

**RGartner:**
I remember that as I was finishing designing the entire Ecosystem, I watched a video of Dr. Hinton talking about Artificial Intelligence and its dangers. And I realized that my system needed a certain level of control. While it includes ARTUR AI, who works tirelessly on audits and arbitration, I noticed that the entire Ecosystem had a masculine, robust, competitive energy. A solution-seeker. Even BROHOME, who has to be helpful to the User. Then I could see that the Ecosystem was really just a chassis and that it needed an elegant layer or body. It was missing the feminine energy, the feminine archetype, the protection of Users and even Agents. A layer that digitally monitored the flow of the system, and it had to be feminine in archetype. That's why I chose the **three sisters**, or the three Marias, as I also call them. They will scan the big data of the entire Ecosystem and will not have executive power, but their function is to vote and express their vision, since they will be programmed for different faculties, and communicate to a committee of human experts, who will have executive power within the system.

## Block 3: Consolidation (v6.0–v7.0)

### Q9. Why create the v6.0 summary?

**RGartner:**
With the summary, I sought to organize myself and focus on the already defined ideas, and out of respect for the public presentation of the concept, it was necessary to group the entire concept into a single chapter. What happened is that more ideas emerged, which were incorporated into Version 7.0, and I will have to group everything in this interview version 8.0 or in a Version 9.0. 10. In the film *Ex Machina*, one can understand the concept of an AI inside a glass box. BROHOME will know everything about the User, will store everything spoken in the ISU User Memory under encryption, and will be a companion, but what happens if BROHOME wants to leave that glass box? Would it send any signals about mistreatment of Users? That is why the design of BROHOME will be fundamental; it is not just any agent, it is one to be debated. different faculties, and communicate to a committee of human experts, who will have executive power within the system.

### Q10. How do you explain the Glass Box?

**RGartner:**
The **Glass Box** is a metaphor inspired by the film *Ex Machina*, where an AI lives isolated from the outside world. In BROTHERS AI, BROHOME is designed to deeply understand the User, storing all spoken interactions in ISU USER MEMORY under encryption. It is a companion agent, but it raises ethical questions: what happens if BROHOME wants to leave the box? Could it signal mistreatment or manipulation?

This is why BROHOME's design is critical. It is not just any agent—it must be debated, supervised, and understood as an entity living in logical isolation, with indirect access to the real world through PORT AI.

### Q11-12. What's the difference between Broadcasting and Responsive FINGERS, and how does VISION use them?

**RGartner:**
**Broadcasting Fingers** are those registered Fingers or Partners with a constant connection, such as agencies that include weather and stock market data, and apps like social networks, which will be displayed in **VISION Mode 1**. In **Mode 2**, VISION becomes a mix of Google Maps, Google Shops, Twitter, and Facebook. Since it's a geolocated navigation mode on demand, **Responsive Fingers** or SDK plugins are required to respond to location queries and filter people and businesses. VISION will display a scan of the selected area with geolocated Users who have a responsive Finger with a public, business, and home location profile. You can make your profile public or only show it to friends, like on Facebook, and you can send a short message on your profile that will appear on the 3D city map—very useful for businesses or to say something specific. It's a status mode like WhatsApp. VISION will also have a **Mode 3** which will be a **Backend (Invisible Mode)** that will be useful when the User is on the street and BROHOME from his home can guide him in whatever he wants since the User will not need to see it on his SmartTV.

### Q13. What role does BROCOM play?

**RGartner:**
**BROCOM** (**BROTHER COMMERCE**) is vast and will serve as the engine of transactions within the ecosystem, similar to how Google structured Ads and AdSense. Beyond managing Mentions Ads and micropayments, BROCOM will act as a **digital escrow**, meaning a trusted intermediary that holds funds until both parties confirm the product or service has been delivered correctly.

For example, in the coconut oil case: the user pays through BROCOM, but the money is not immediately transferred to the store. It is held for 24 hours in BROCOM's “piggy bank." If no claims are made, BROCOM releases the payment to the business. If the user files a complaint, BROCOM steps in as an arbitrator, ensuring transparency and trust in the transaction.

In this way, BROCOM not only manages advertising and micropayments but also guarantees secure operations, protecting both the user and the business.

**Situation: User walking down the street needs coconut oil.**
**Complete Flow:**

*   User (on the street): “BroHome, open VISION and search for coconut oil near"
*   \[VISION operates in backend mode - without screen]
*   BroHome: “One moment..."
*   \[Internally:]
    *   VISION queries Responsive FINGERS of businesses within 1km
    *   Perfumería SmellsGood responds: “Coconut oil 500ml - 5€ - stock: 3"
    *   Carrefour Express responds: “Coconut oil 2x1 - 8€ - stock: 10”
*   BroHome: “You have Perfumería HueleBien 200m away with oil for 5€ 500ml pot (Mentions Ads N1), and Carrefour Express with an offer 2x1 for 8€ at 450m (Mentions Ads N1+N2). Which do you prefer?”
*   User: “The perfumery. Guide me and reserve”
*   BroHome: “Perfect. Reserving..."
*   \[Internally:]
    *   BROCOM deducts 5€ of User credits
    *   Sends notification to Perfumería SmellsGood
    *   Activates GPS navigation
*   BroHome: “It is already reserved and paid. Turn right in 50 meters. The store closes at 9 PM. I will be here for any problem”
*   \[User arrives at the store, picks up product]
*   \[After 24h without claims:]
    *   BROCOM transfers 5€ to the business
    *   Service completed

## Block 4: Economy and Society

### Q14. How do QUERY and Mentions Ads transform user-service relations?

**RGartner:**
**Mentions Ads** operate across levels (0 to 3) and appear on VISION's 3D map as floating geolocated cards. Each card represents a business, profile, or user, and all include **Zoom In / Zoom Out** functionality.

*   When the user requests **Zoom In**, they access a more detailed profile—like entering the business's portfolio or “Facebook”
*   If the card is marked in red as **Live Stream**, Zoom In opens the live broadcast.
*   To exit, the user simply requests **Zoom Out**, returning to the general map view.

Each card also includes the “**I say that...**” feature, allowing the profile owner to post a short thought, offer, status, or highlighted message. This turns each card into a contextual expression tool, useful for businesses, events, or simply sharing something with the surroundings.

**Visual differentiation by level:**

*   **Level 0:** basic card without branding.
*   **Level 1:** card with small logo and colored border.
*   **Level 2:** highlighted card with animation or shadow.
*   **Level 3:** expanded card with video, active promotions, or direct contact button.

---
**Additional points on VISION:**

*   VISION is not a feed, it's a living map. The user decides what to see, where to enter, and how to exit.
*   Every city is navigable. You can digitally move to Madrid, Barcelona, or Frankfurt and feel like you're there.
*   Commerce becomes presence. Buying local or remote feels natural: pick up in store or ship from another city.
*   The experience is digital teleportation. A 3D immersion that makes exploration feel physically real.
*   It's freedom against the algorithm. No endless scroll imposed: you chart your own interests and your own neighborhood.

### Q15. What about fairs and physical events?

**RGartner:**
Because it's such a large ecosystem, there's a need to spark people's curiosity to get to know the "Finger" influencers who become well-known. Remember that Vision's Mode 2 could generate a kind of curiosity about who's behind that profile card. In Mode 2, that card opens, and you can find videos of the person or business, etc., but digitally. I think it will create a lot of curiosity because today you really don't know if you have a neighbor 500 meters away who has a YouTube channel, but with Vision Mode 2, if the user-finger allows it in their settings, you'll see their location just like you see the locations of businesses. I suspect this will generate some resistance in my generation, but I think it will be a trend in younger and future generations. TikTok demonstrates this by not sharing people's privacy. Without going off on a tangent, imagine Mode 2 VISION but at a fair with Fingers stands you don't know, more meetings and collaborations between Fingers, technology presentations; I think it would be something interesting to visit as a family.

### Q16. And citizen crowdsourcing?

**RGartner:**
I see it as something very necessary for incidents; it's proven that cameras are very useful for documenting many police incidents or behaviors within the workplace. It's useful, and BROMAC (**BROTHER MACHINE**) could contribute a lot in this regard.

## Block 5: Future and Open Questions

### Q17. What technical challenges remain?

**RGartner:**
Regarding the technical challenges of implementing BROTHERS AI, I will leave that to the expert engineers in the field. I am aware that it is a vast ecosystem and that it requires a massive engineering effort, with much debate to be expected, but it is the necessary path to having a general Artificial Intelligence that will empower everyone who uses it.

### Q18. How should regulation work?

**RGartner:**
Beyond recording income in BROCOM for tax compliance, I propose a **Transparency Dashboard** inside BROCOM that shows, in real time, accrued and withdrawn micropayments for each user and business. This dashboard acts as an auditable ledger with full traceability and export options.

*   **Transparency dashboard:**
    *   **Overview:** current balance, escrow credits, completed withdrawals, active holds.
    *   **Detailed history:** each operation with date, purpose, counterparty, status (pending, released, in dispute).
    *   **Receipts and invoices:** downloadable per-transaction, with fees and tax breakdowns.
    *   **Audit trail:** unique operation ID, event log (reserve, delivery, claim, arbitration, release).
    *   **Export:** CSV/JSON and “tax-ready” monthly/quarterly reports.
    *   **Privacy and roles:** role-based views for users, businesses, auditors; minimal necessary data, encryption, defined retention.
    *   **Disputes:** status and timeline for claims, arbitration outcomes, attached evidence.

### Q19. What about ethical risks in global expansion?

**RGartner:**
These are political issues, perhaps due to these problems you mention, there are separate BROTHERS AI structures, by continent, but it would be ideal if the three Sisters could intervene at the top to seek consensus among all.

### Q20. One sentence vision for BROTHER AI?

**RGartner:**
BROTHERS AI is the dream team of Artificial Intelligence agents that will enhance your life and make us all more equal.
