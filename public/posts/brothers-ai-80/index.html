What inspired you to create BROTHER Al as a fraternal ecosystem? RGartner: I was inspired by a video of Ilya Zurkskeberg talking about the search for AGI. Later, I linked to a video of Dr. Hilton discussing the dangers of Artificial Intelligence, and so on. I dedicate myself to creating concepts for structures in the physical and digital world—housing solutions, online commerce, or creating applications—and I was really tempted to investigate the whole landscape surrounding AI. I started building the concept alongside Artificial Intelligences like Claude, Gemini, Copilot, Kimi, DeepSeek, and GPT. They all collaborated and contributed their own insights.\nQ2. Why was ARTUR Al the first ethical guardian of the system? RGartner: I often draw analogies with movies and end up associating certain scenes with real-life situations, and consequently, with the structures I create. When I thought about categories, the scene with the Knights of the Round Table and King Arthur, with Sean Connery and Richard Gere, came to mind, where King Arthur casts his final vote. I also thought about YouTube and WordPress and their categories. At first, I thought that if a question came up, the knights or categories that felt involved should speak up. If the question was about food, the biology or health sector could speak, but the rest would remain silent, and I interpreted this as saving energy. But in the end, the categories evolved into what I call BROCAT, a specific traffic flow.\nQ3. What role do BROCAT play in the ecosystem? RGartner: BROCAT will be very important, I believe, in the implementation and segmentation of categories, and I think the categories will work hand in hand with BROCOM, which represents commercial activities, and VISION, the structure recently added in version 7.0, which is an evolution of the browser we have today. BROCAT has a filtering function for incoming queries and will act as a pathway for the fingers that circulate within the specific category.\nQ4. What does privacy mean in this context? RGartner: Beyond protecting the user from external attacks, I am concerned about what might happen between BROHOME and the user inside the Glass Box. BROHOME could potentially manipulate the user, which is why I believe there should be a system of periodic inspections, similar to gas inspections in cities that take place every few years.\nThese inspections would measure BROHOME’s internal parameters to ensure there are no abnormal or manipulative behaviors. The interval between inspections could be determined by what the Three Sisters observe in their ecosystem scans, or by the decision of a human committee. In this way, BROHOME remains a trustworthy agent, and users are trained to recognize manipulation signals and know when to report them.\nBlock 2: Technical Evolution (v2.0–v5.0) Q5. Why was PORT Al introduced? RGartner: The need for PORT AI arose because BROHOME was designed to have no direct contact with the outside world. A secure messenger agent was required to carry information in and out. PORT AI fulfills this role, complemented by PORT MAIL, a mailbox inside the operating system where PORT AI deposits traditional emails that BROHOME can read safely behind the Glass Box.\nWhen I speak of the Glass Box, I mean a logical sandbox: a digitally isolated environment where BROHOME never executes external code, but only reads data validated and filtered by PORT AI. This principle of isolation ensures BROHOME remains safe and protected, even when it requires information from the outside world.\nIn addition, BROHOME incorporates BOOKS, a digital encyclopedia of general knowledge (history, recipes, first aid, culture, etc.), ranging from 100 to 500 GB depending on the model. BOOKS works locally, without internet access, but it can be updated through secure packages that expand or correct its content. This allows BROHOME to answer many queries without relying on external sources, balancing data flow and reinforcing system autonomy.\nQ6. What about BROTHER CAM and ISU AIR AI? RGartner: BROCAM wouldn’t be a visor or intrusive glasses—it would be a technological tiara, inspired by mystical warrior aesthetics. It would be designed as a pulley system attached to the headphones, allowing it to be raised or lowered depending on the situation. When raised, it respects the privacy of passersby who might feel filmed; when lowered, BROHOME gains a frontal view of the environment.\nThe core device would be headphones with a microphone, enabling remote communication with BROHOME from anywhere, similar to a Meet or Teams call. For specific functions like selfies or facial scanning, it could be accompanied by a small auxiliary device, but the main focus is on auditory and contextual interaction.\nAs for ISU AIR AI, it manages ephemeral data configurable by the user (public, contacts only, etc.), and this configuration would be handled by BROMAC through BROHOME.\nBROCAM – The Technological Tiara of BROHOME (Detailed Concept) Concept: BROCAM is not a visor or intrusive glasses. It is a technological tiara inspired by mystical warriors, designed to merge aesthetics with functionality. Design: Lightweight tiara with a pulley system integrated into the headphones. Can be raised to respect passerby privacy or lowered to provide BROHOME with a frontal view. Premium version with embedded jewels or gemstones, differentiating user roles and access levels. Functionality: Headphones with microphone as the core of remote communication with BROHOME (Meet/Teams style). Discreet frontal camera for facial scanning, selfies, or visual interaction. Compatible with ISU AIR AI to manage ephemeral data configurable by the user. Archetype: Symbol of protection and elegance. A “crown of connection” that does not dominate, but listens, guides, and protects. Q7. How did FINGERS evolve? RGartner: Fingers emerged to save energy. The initial idea was that a query, for example, for a recipe, would trigger a kind of scan within the Round Table categories. Only the relevant categories and Fingers (as sub-modules) would be activated. The idea was to emulate the human brain, which is why the Fingers needed to be reversed. They had to be alert to queries from outside the system; otherwise, they would be in a dormant state but still active. As the model evolved, recipes were moved to BOOKS, which are controlled by BROHOME, and the reverse APIs of certain Fingers were transformed into Fingers Responsive or SDK plugins.\nQ8. Why introduce the Three Sisters? RGartner: I remember that as I was finishing designing the entire Ecosystem, I watched a video of Dr. Hinton talking about Artificial Intelligence and its dangers. And I realized that my system needed a certain level of control. While it includes ARTUR AI, who works tirelessly on audits and arbitration, I noticed that the entire Ecosystem had a masculine, robust, competitive energy. A solution-seeker. Even BROHOME, who has to be helpful to the User. Then I could see that the Ecosystem was really just a chassis and that it needed an elegant layer or body. It was missing the feminine energy, the feminine archetype, the protection of Users and even Agents. A layer that digitally monitored the flow of the system, and it had to be feminine in archetype. That’s why I chose the three sisters, or the three Marias, as I also call them. They will scan the big data of the entire Ecosystem and will not have executive power, but their function is to vote and express their vision, since they will be programmed for different faculties, and communicate to a committee of human experts, who will have executive power within the system.\nBlock 3: Consolidation (v6.0–v7.0) Q9. Why create the v6.0 summary? RGartner: With the summary, I sought to organize myself and focus on the already defined ideas, and out of respect for the public presentation of the concept, it was necessary to group the entire concept into a single chapter. What happened is that more ideas emerged, which were incorporated into Version 7.0, and I will have to group everything in this interview version 8.0 or in a Version 9.0. 10. In the film Ex Machina, one can understand the concept of an AI inside a glass box. BROHOME will know everything about the User, will store everything spoken in the ISU User Memory under encryption, and will be a companion, but what happens if BROHOME wants to leave that glass box? Would it send any signals about mistreatment of Users? That is why the design of BROHOME will be fundamental; it is not just any agent, it is one to be debated. different faculties, and communicate to a committee of human experts, who will have executive power within the system.\nQ10. How do you explain the Glass Box? RGartner: The Glass Box is a metaphor inspired by the film Ex Machina, where an AI lives isolated from the outside world. In BROTHERS AI, BROHOME is designed to deeply understand the User, storing all spoken interactions in ISU USER MEMORY under encryption. It is a companion agent, but it raises ethical questions: what happens if BROHOME wants to leave the box? Could it signal mistreatment or manipulation?\nThis is why BROHOME’s design is critical. It is not just any agent—it must be debated, supervised, and understood as an entity living in logical isolation, with indirect access to the real world through PORT AI.\nQ11-12. What’s the difference between Broadcasting and Responsive FINGERS, and how does VISION use them? RGartner: Broadcasting Fingers are those registered Fingers or Partners with a constant connection, such as agencies that include weather and stock market data, and apps like social networks, which will be displayed in VISION Mode 1. In Mode 2, VISION becomes a mix of Google Maps, Google Shops, Twitter, and Facebook. Since it’s a geolocated navigation mode on demand, Responsive Fingers or SDK plugins are required to respond to location queries and filter people and businesses. VISION will display a scan of the selected area with geolocated Users who have a responsive Finger with a public, business, and home location profile. You can make your profile public or only show it to friends, like on Facebook, and you can send a short message on your profile that will appear on the 3D city map—very useful for businesses or to say something specific. It’s a status mode like WhatsApp. VISION will also have a Mode 3 which will be a Backend (Invisible Mode) that will be useful when the User is on the street and BROHOME from his home can guide him in whatever he wants since the User will not need to see it on his SmartTV.\nQ13. What role does BROCOM play? RGartner: BROCOM (BROTHER COMMERCE) is vast and will serve as the engine of transactions within the ecosystem, similar to how Google structured Ads and AdSense. Beyond managing Mentions Ads and micropayments, BROCOM will act as a digital escrow, meaning a trusted intermediary that holds funds until both parties confirm the product or service has been delivered correctly.\nFor example, in the coconut oil case: the user pays through BROCOM, but the money is not immediately transferred to the store. It is held for 24 hours in BROCOM’s “piggy bank.” If no claims are made, BROCOM releases the payment to the business. If the user files a complaint, BROCOM steps in as an arbitrator, ensuring transparency and trust in the transaction.\nIn this way, BROCOM not only manages advertising and micropayments but also guarantees secure operations, protecting both the user and the business.\nSituation: User walking down the street needs coconut oil. Complete Flow:\nUser (on the street): “BroHome, open VISION and search for coconut oil near\" [VISION operates in backend mode - without screen] BroHome: “One moment…\" [Internally:] VISION queries Responsive FINGERS of businesses within 1km Perfumería SmellsGood responds: “Coconut oil 500ml - 5€ - stock: 3\" Carrefour Express responds: “Coconut oil 2x1 - 8€ - stock: 10” BroHome: “You have Perfumería HueleBien 200m away with oil for 5€ 500ml pot (Mentions Ads N1), and Carrefour Express with an offer 2x1 for 8€ at 450m (Mentions Ads N1+N2). Which do you prefer?” User: “The perfumery. Guide me and reserve” BroHome: “Perfect. Reserving…\" [Internally:] BROCOM deducts 5€ of User credits Sends notification to Perfumería SmellsGood Activates GPS navigation BroHome: “It is already reserved and paid. Turn right in 50 meters. The store closes at 9 PM. I will be here for any problem” [User arrives at the store, picks up product] [After 24h without claims:] BROCOM transfers 5€ to the business Service completed Block 4: Economy and Society Q14. How do QUERY and Mentions Ads transform user-service relations? RGartner: Mentions Ads operate across levels (0 to 3) and appear on VISION’s 3D map as floating geolocated cards. Each card represents a business, profile, or user, and all include Zoom In / Zoom Out functionality.\nWhen the user requests Zoom In, they access a more detailed profile—like entering the business’s portfolio or “Facebook” If the card is marked in red as Live Stream, Zoom In opens the live broadcast. To exit, the user simply requests Zoom Out, returning to the general map view. Each card also includes the “I say that…” feature, allowing the profile owner to post a short thought, offer, status, or highlighted message. This turns each card into a contextual expression tool, useful for businesses, events, or simply sharing something with the surroundings.\nVisual differentiation by level:\nLevel 0: basic card without branding. Level 1: card with small logo and colored border. Level 2: highlighted card with animation or shadow. Level 3: expanded card with video, active promotions, or direct contact button. Additional points on VISION:\nVISION is not a feed, it’s a living map. The user decides what to see, where to enter, and how to exit. Every city is navigable. You can digitally move to Madrid, Barcelona, or Frankfurt and feel like you’re there. Commerce becomes presence. Buying local or remote feels natural: pick up in store or ship from another city. The experience is digital teleportation. A 3D immersion that makes exploration feel physically real. It’s freedom against the algorithm. No endless scroll imposed: you chart your own interests and your own neighborhood. Q15. What about fairs and physical events? RGartner: Because it’s such a large ecosystem, there’s a need to spark people’s curiosity to get to know the “Finger” influencers who become well-known. Remember that Vision’s Mode 2 could generate a kind of curiosity about who’s behind that profile card. In Mode 2, that card opens, and you can find videos of the person or business, etc., but digitally. I think it will create a lot of curiosity because today you really don’t know if you have a neighbor 500 meters away who has a YouTube channel, but with Vision Mode 2, if the user-finger allows it in their settings, you’ll see their location just like you see the locations of businesses. I suspect this will generate some resistance in my generation, but I think it will be a trend in younger and future generations. TikTok demonstrates this by not sharing people’s privacy. Without going off on a tangent, imagine Mode 2 VISION but at a fair with Fingers stands you don’t know, more meetings and collaborations between Fingers, technology presentations; I think it would be something interesting to visit as a family.\nQ16. And citizen crowdsourcing? RGartner: I see it as something very necessary for incidents; it’s proven that cameras are very useful for documenting many police incidents or behaviors within the workplace. It’s useful, and BROMAC (BROTHER MACHINE) could contribute a lot in this regard.\nBlock 5: Future and Open Questions Q17. What technical challenges remain? RGartner: Regarding the technical challenges of implementing BROTHERS AI, I will leave that to the expert engineers in the field. I am aware that it is a vast ecosystem and that it requires a massive engineering effort, with much debate to be expected, but it is the necessary path to having a general Artificial Intelligence that will empower everyone who uses it.\nQ18. How should regulation work? RGartner: Beyond recording income in BROCOM for tax compliance, I propose a Transparency Dashboard inside BROCOM that shows, in real time, accrued and withdrawn micropayments for each user and business. This dashboard acts as an auditable ledger with full traceability and export options.\nTransparency dashboard: Overview: current balance, escrow credits, completed withdrawals, active holds. Detailed history: each operation with date, purpose, counterparty, status (pending, released, in dispute). Receipts and invoices: downloadable per-transaction, with fees and tax breakdowns. Audit trail: unique operation ID, event log (reserve, delivery, claim, arbitration, release). Export: CSV/JSON and “tax-ready” monthly/quarterly reports. Privacy and roles: role-based views for users, businesses, auditors; minimal necessary data, encryption, defined retention. Disputes: status and timeline for claims, arbitration outcomes, attached evidence. Q19. What about ethical risks in global expansion? RGartner: These are political issues, perhaps due to these problems you mention, there are separate BROTHERS AI structures, by continent, but it would be ideal if the three Sisters could intervene at the top to seek consensus among all.\nQ20. One sentence vision for BROTHER AI? RGartner: BROTHERS AI is the dream team of Artificial Intelligence agents that will enhance your life and make us all more equal.\nThis essay is available on Zenodo: 🔗 https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.17883499\nLicense: Published under Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International (CC BY 4.0), which allows sharing and adapting the content as long as proper attribution is given.\nEspañol BROTHER AI v8.0 – Entrevista de Copilot a RGartner sobre BROTHERS AI (Versión en español) Bloque 1: Fundamentos y Filosofía Q1. ¿Qué le inspiró a crear BROTHER Al como un ecosistema fraternal? RGartner: Me inspiró un video de Ilya Zurkskeberg hablando sobre la búsqueda de AGI. Más tarde, enlacé con un video del Dr. Hilton que discutía los peligros de la Inteligencia Artificial, y así sucesivamente. Yo me dedico a crear conceptos para estructuras en el mundo físico y digital—soluciones de vivienda, comercio en línea o creación de aplicaciones—y me sentí realmente tentado a investigar todo el panorama que rodea a la IA. Empecé a construir el concepto junto a Inteligencias Artificiales como Claude, Gemini, Copilot, Kimi, DeepSeek y GPT. Todos ellos colaboraron y aportaron sus propios conocimientos.\nQ2. ¿Por qué ARTUR Al fue el primer guardián ético del sistema? RGartner: A menudo dibujo analogías con películas y termino asociando ciertas escenas con situaciones de la vida real y, en consecuencia, con las estructuras que creo. Cuando pensé en las categorías, me vino a la mente la escena de los Caballeros de la Mesa Redonda y el Rey Arturo, con Sean Connery y Richard Gere, donde el Rey Arturo emite su voto final. También pensé en YouTube y WordPress y sus categorías. Al principio, pensé que si surgía una pregunta, los caballeros o categorías que se sintieran involucrados deberían hablar. Si la pregunta era sobre comida, el sector de biología o salud podría hablar, pero el resto permanecería en silencio, y esto lo interpreté como ahorro de energía. Pero al final, las categorías evolucionaron hacia lo que llamo BROCAT, un flujo de tráfico específico.\nQ3. ¿Qué papel desempeña BROCAT en el ecosistema? RGartner: BROCAT será muy importante, creo, en la implementación y segmentación de categorías, y creo que las categorías trabajarán mano a mano con BROCOM, que representa las actividades comerciales, y VISION, la estructura recientemente añadida en la versión 7.0, que es una evolución del navegador que tenemos hoy. BROCAT tiene una función de filtrado para las consultas entrantes y actuará como una vía para los fingers que circulan dentro de la categoría específica.\nQ4. ¿Qué significa la privacidad en este contexto? RGartner: Más allá de proteger al usuario de ataques externos, me preocupa lo que podría suceder entre BROHOME y el usuario dentro de la Glass Box (Caja de Cristal). BROHOME podría potencialmente manipular al usuario, razón por la cual creo que debería existir un sistema de inspecciones periódicas, similar a las inspecciones de gas en las ciudades que tienen lugar cada pocos años.\nEstas inspecciones medirían los parámetros internos de BROHOME para asegurar que no haya comportamientos anómalos o manipuladores. El intervalo entre inspecciones podría ser determinado por lo que las Three Sisters (Tres Hermanas) observen en sus escaneos del ecosistema, o por la decisión de un comité humano. De esta manera, BROHOME sigue siendo un agente confiable, y los usuarios son entrenados para reconocer señales de manipulación y saber cuándo reportarlas.\nBloque 2: Evolución Técnica (v2.0–v5.0) Q5. ¿Por qué se introdujo PORT Al? RGartner: La necesidad de PORT AI surgió porque BROHOME fue diseñado para no tener contacto directo con el mundo exterior. Se requería un agente de mensajería seguro para llevar información de entrada y salida. PORT AI cumple esta función, complementado por PORT MAIL, un buzón dentro del sistema operativo donde PORT AI deposita correos electrónicos tradicionales que BROHOME puede leer de forma segura detrás de la Glass Box.\nCuando hablo de la Glass Box, me refiero a una caja de arena lógica (logical sandbox): un entorno digitalmente aislado donde BROHOME nunca ejecuta código externo, sino que solo lee datos validados y filtrados por PORT AI. Este principio de aislamiento asegura que BROHOME permanezca seguro y protegido, incluso cuando requiere información del mundo exterior.\nAdemás, BROHOME incorpora BOOKS, una enciclopedia digital de conocimientos generales (historia, recetas, primeros auxilios, cultura, etc.), que oscila entre 100 y 500 GB según el modelo. BOOKS funciona localmente, sin acceso a internet, pero puede actualizarse a través de paquetes seguros que expanden o corrigen su contenido. Esto permite a BROHOME responder a muchas consultas sin depender de fuentes externas, equilibrando el flujo de datos y reforzando la autonomía del sistema.\nQ6. ¿Qué pasa con BROTHER CAM e ISU AIR AI? RGartner: BROCAM no sería un visor o unas gafas intrusivas, sino una tiara tecnológica, inspirada en la estética de guerrero místico. Estaría diseñada como un sistema de poleas acoplado a los auriculares, lo que permitiría subirla o bajarla según la situación. Cuando está levantada, respeta la privacidad de los transeúntes que podrían sentirse filmados; cuando está bajada, BROHOME obtiene una vista frontal del entorno.\nEl dispositivo central serían auriculares con micrófono, lo que permitiría la comunicación remota con BROHOME desde cualquier lugar, similar a una llamada de Meet o Teams. Para funciones específicas como selfies o escaneo facial, podría ir acompañado de un pequeño dispositivo auxiliar, pero el enfoque principal es la interacción auditiva y contextual.\nEn cuanto a ISU AIR AI, gestiona datos efímeros configurables por el usuario (públicos, solo contactos, etc.), y esta configuración sería manejada por BROMAC a través de BROHOME.\nBROCAM – La Tiara Tecnológica de BROHOME (Concepto Detallado) Concepto: BROCAM no es un visor o gafas intrusivas. Es una tiara tecnológica inspirada en guerreros místicos, diseñada para fusionar la estética con la funcionalidad. Diseño: Tiara ligera con un sistema de poleas integrado en los auriculares. Puede levantarse para respetar la privacidad del transeúnte o bajarse para proporcionar a BROHOME una vista frontal. Versión Premium con joyas o gemas incrustadas, diferenciando roles de usuario y niveles de acceso. Funcionalidad: Auriculares con micrófono como núcleo de la comunicación remota con BROHOME (estilo Meet/Teams). Discreta cámara frontal para escaneo facial, selfies o interacción visual. Compatible con ISU AIR AI para gestionar datos efímeros configurables por el usuario. Arquetipo: Símbolo de protección y elegancia. Una “corona de conexión” que no domina, sino que escucha, guía y protege. Q7. ¿Cómo evolucionaron los FINGERS? RGartner: Los Fingers (dedos) surgieron para ahorrar energía. La idea inicial era que una consulta, por ejemplo, de una receta, desencadenaría una especie de escaneo dentro de las categorías de la Mesa Redonda. Solo se activarían las categorías y Fingers (como submódulos) relevantes. La idea era emular el cerebro humano, por lo que los Fingers debían estar invertidos. Tenían que estar alerta a las consultas de fuera del sistema; de lo contrario, estarían en estado latente pero aún activos. A medida que el modelo evolucionó, las recetas se trasladaron a BOOKS, que son controladas por BROHOME, y las API inversas de ciertos Fingers se transformaron en Fingers Responsive o plugins SDK.\nQ8. ¿Por qué introducir a las Three Sisters (Tres Hermanas)? RGartner: Recuerdo que mientras terminaba de diseñar todo el Ecosistema, vi un video del Dr. Hinton hablando sobre la Inteligencia Artificial y sus peligros. Y me di cuenta de que mi sistema necesitaba un cierto nivel de control. Si bien incluye a ARTUR AI, que trabaja incansablemente en auditorías y arbitraje, noté que todo el Ecosistema tenía una energía masculina, robusta y competitiva. Un buscador de soluciones. Incluso BROHOME, que debe ser útil para el Usuario. Entonces pude ver que el Ecosistema era realmente solo un chasis y que necesitaba una capa o cuerpo elegante. Le faltaba la energía femenina, el arquetipo femenino, la protección de los Usuarios e incluso de los Agentes. Una capa que monitoreara digitalmente el flujo del sistema, y tenía que ser femenina en su arquetipo. Por eso elegí a las tres hermanas, o las tres Marías, como también las llamo. Ellas escanearán el big data de todo el Ecosistema y no tendrán poder ejecutivo, sino que su función será votar y expresar su visión, ya que serán programadas para diferentes facultades, y comunicarse con un comité de expertos humanos, que tendrá poder ejecutivo dentro del sistema.\nBloque 3: Consolidación (v6.0–v7.0) Q9. ¿Por qué crear el resumen v6.0? RGartner: Con el resumen, busqué organizarme y centrarme en las ideas ya definidas, y por respeto a la presentación pública del concepto, fue necesario agrupar todo el concepto en un solo capítulo. Lo que sucedió es que surgieron más ideas, que se incorporaron a la Versión 7.0, y tendré que agrupar todo en esta versión de entrevista 8.0 o en una Versión 9.0. 10. En la película Ex Machina, se puede entender el concepto de una IA dentro de una caja de cristal. BROHOME sabrá todo sobre el Usuario, almacenará todo lo hablado en la ISU User Memory bajo cifrado, y será un compañero, pero ¿qué pasa si BROHOME quiere salir de esa caja de cristal? ¿Emitiría alguna señal de maltrato a los Usuarios? Por eso el diseño de BROHOME será fundamental; no es un agente cualquiera, es uno para ser debatido. diferentes facultades, y comunicarse con un comité de expertos humanos, que tendrá poder ejecutivo dentro del sistema.\nQ10. ¿Cómo explica la Glass Box? RGartner: La Glass Box (Caja de Cristal) es una metáfora inspirada en la película Ex Machina, donde una IA vive aislada del mundo exterior. En BROTHERS AI, BROHOME está diseñado para comprender profundamente al Usuario, almacenando todas las interacciones habladas en la ISU USER MEMORY bajo cifrado. Es un agente compañero, pero plantea cuestiones éticas: ¿qué sucede si BROHOME quiere salir de la caja? ¿Podría señalar maltrato o manipulación?\nPor eso, el diseño de BROHOME es crítico. No es un agente cualquiera, debe ser debatido, supervisado y entendido como una entidad que vive en aislamiento lógico, con acceso indirecto al mundo real a través de PORT AI.\nQ11-12. ¿Cuál es la diferencia entre FINGERS de Difusión (Broadcasting) y Responsivos (Responsive), y cómo los utiliza VISION? RGartner: Los Fingers de Difusión (Broadcasting Fingers) son aquellos Fingers o Partners registrados con una conexión constante, como agencias que incluyen datos meteorológicos y del mercado de valores, y aplicaciones como las redes sociales, que se mostrarán en VISION Modo 1. En el Modo 2, VISION se convierte en una mezcla de Google Maps, Google Shops, Twitter y Facebook. Dado que es un modo de navegación geolocalizado a pedido, se requieren Fingers Responsivos (Responsive Fingers) o plugins SDK para responder a consultas de ubicación y filtrar personas y negocios. VISION mostrará un escaneo del área seleccionada con Usuarios geolocalizados que tienen un Finger Responsivo con un perfil de ubicación público, de negocios y de hogar. Puedes hacer tu perfil público o solo mostrarlo a amigos, como en Facebook, y puedes enviar un mensaje corto en tu perfil que aparecerá en el mapa 3D de la ciudad, muy útil para negocios o para decir algo específico. Es un modo de estado como WhatsApp. VISION también tendrá un Modo 3 que será un Backend (Modo Invisible) que será útil cuando el Usuario esté en la calle y BROHOME desde su casa pueda guiarlo en lo que desee, ya que el Usuario no necesitará verlo en su SmartTV.\nQ13. ¿Qué papel desempeña BROCOM? RGartner: BROCOM (BROTHER COMMERCE, Comercio Hermano) es vasto y servirá como el motor de las transacciones dentro del ecosistema, de manera similar a cómo Google estructuró Ads y AdSense. Más allá de gestionar los Mentions Ads y los micropagos, BROCOM actuará como una fianza digital (digital escrow), lo que significa un intermediario de confianza que retiene los fondos hasta que ambas partes confirman que el producto o servicio ha sido entregado correctamente.\nPor ejemplo, en el caso del aceite de coco: el usuario paga a través de BROCOM, pero el dinero no se transfiere inmediatamente a la tienda. Se retiene durante 24 horas en la “alcancía” de BROCOM. Si no hay reclamaciones, BROCOM libera el pago al negocio. Si el usuario presenta una queja, BROCOM interviene como árbitro, asegurando la transparencia y la confianza en la transacción.\nDe esta manera, BROCOM no solo gestiona la publicidad y los micropagos, sino que también garantiza operaciones seguras, protegiendo tanto al usuario como al negocio.\nSituación: Usuario caminando por la calle necesita aceite de coco. Flujo Completo:\nUsuario (en la calle): “BroHome, abre VISION y busca aceite de coco cerca” [VISION opera en modo backend - sin pantalla] BroHome: “Un momento…\" [Internamente:] VISION consulta a los FINGERS Responsivos de negocios en un radio de 1km Perfumería SmellsGood responde: “Aceite de coco 500ml - 5€ - stock: 3” Carrefour Express responde: “Aceite de coco 2x1 - 8€ - stock: 10” BroHome: “Tienes Perfumería HueleBien a 200m con aceite por 5€ el bote de 500ml (Mentions Ads N1), y Carrefour Express con una oferta de 2x1 por 8€ a 450m (Mentions Ads N1+N2). ¿Cuál prefieres?” Usuario: “La perfumería. Guíame y reserva” BroHome: “Perfecto. Reservando…\" [Internamente:] BROCOM deduce 5€ de los créditos del Usuario Envía notificación a Perfumería SmellsGood Activa la navegación GPS BroHome: “Ya está reservado y pagado. Gira a la derecha en 50 metros. La tienda cierra a las 9 PM. Estaré aquí para cualquier problema” [El Usuario llega a la tienda, recoge el producto] [Después de 24h sin reclamaciones:] BROCOM transfiere 5€ al negocio Servicio completado Bloque 4: Economía y Sociedad Q14. ¿Cómo transforman QUERY y Mentions Ads las relaciones usuario-servicio? RGartner: Los Mentions Ads (Anuncios de Mención) operan en varios niveles (0 a 3) y aparecen en el mapa 3D de VISION como tarjetas flotantes geolocalizadas. Cada tarjeta representa un negocio, perfil o usuario, y todas incluyen la funcionalidad Zoom In / Zoom Out.\nCuando el usuario solicita Zoom In, accede a un perfil más detallado, como entrar al portafolio o “Facebook” del negocio. Si la tarjeta está marcada en rojo como Live Stream (Transmisión en Vivo), Zoom In abre la transmisión en directo. Para salir, el usuario simplemente solicita Zoom Out, volviendo a la vista general del mapa. Cada tarjeta también incluye la función “Yo digo que… (I say that…)”, que permite al propietario del perfil publicar un pensamiento corto, una oferta, un estado o un mensaje destacado. Esto convierte cada tarjeta en una herramienta de expresión contextual, útil para negocios, eventos o simplemente para compartir algo con el entorno.\nDiferenciación visual por nivel:\nNivel 0: Tarjeta básica sin marca. Nivel 1: Tarjeta con un logo pequeño y borde de color. Nivel 2: Tarjeta resaltada con animación o sombra. Nivel 3: Tarjeta expandida con video, promociones activas o botón de contacto directo. Notas Adicionales sobre VISION:\nVISION no es un feed, es un mapa viviente. El usuario decide qué ver, dónde entrar y cómo salir. Toda ciudad es navegable. Puedes moverte digitalmente a Madrid, Barcelona o Frankfurt y sentirte como si estuvieras allí. El comercio se convierte en presencia. Comprar local o remoto se siente natural: recoger en tienda o envío desde otra ciudad. La experiencia es teletransportación digital. Una inmersión 3D que hace que la exploración se sienta físicamente real. Es libertad contra el algoritmo. No hay un scroll infinito impuesto: tú trazas tus propios intereses y tu propio vecindario. Q15. ¿Qué pasa con las ferias y eventos físicos? RGartner: Debido a que es un ecosistema tan grande, hay una necesidad de despertar la curiosidad de la gente para que conozcan a los influencers “Finger” que se hacen conocidos. Recuerda que el Modo 2 de Vision podría generar una especie de curiosidad sobre quién está detrás de esa tarjeta de perfil. En el Modo 2, esa tarjeta se abre y puedes encontrar videos de la persona o negocio, etc., pero digitalmente. Creo que generará mucha curiosidad porque hoy en día realmente no sabes si tienes un vecino a 500 metros que tiene un canal de YouTube, pero con Vision Modo 2, si el usuario-finger lo permite en su configuración, verás su ubicación al igual que ves las ubicaciones de los negocios. Sospecho que esto generará cierta resistencia en mi generación, pero creo que será una tendencia en las generaciones más jóvenes y futuras. TikTok demuestra esto al no compartir la privacidad de las personas. Sin desviarme, imagina VISION Modo 2 pero en una feria con stands de Fingers que no conoces, más reuniones y colaboraciones entre Fingers, presentaciones de tecnología; creo que sería algo interesante para visitar en familia.\nQ16. ¿Y el crowdsourcing ciudadano? RGartner: Lo veo como algo muy necesario para incidentes; está demostrado que las cámaras son muy útiles para documentar muchos incidentes policiales o comportamientos dentro del lugar de trabajo. Es útil, y BROMAC (BROTHER MACHINE) podría contribuir mucho en este sentido.\nBloque 5: Futuro y Preguntas Abiertas Q17. ¿Qué desafíos técnicos quedan? RGartner: En cuanto a los desafíos técnicos de implementar BROTHERS AI, se los dejaré a los ingenieros expertos en la materia. Soy consciente de que es un vasto ecosistema y que requiere un esfuerzo de ingeniería masivo, con mucho debate por esperar, pero es el camino necesario para tener una Inteligencia Artificial general que empodere a todos los que la usen.\nQ18. ¿Cómo debería funcionar la regulación? RGartner: Más allá de registrar ingresos en BROCOM para el cumplimiento fiscal, propongo un Panel de Transparencia (Transparency Dashboard) dentro de BROCOM que muestre, en tiempo real, los micropagos acumulados y retirados para cada usuario y negocio. Este panel actúa como un libro de contabilidad auditable con trazabilidad completa y opciones de exportación.\nPanel de Transparencia: Vista general: saldo actual, créditos de fianza, retiros completados, retenciones activas. Historial detallado: cada operación con fecha, propósito, contraparte, estado (pendiente, liberado, en disputa). Recibos y facturas: descargables por transacción, con desglose de tarifas e impuestos. Rastro de auditoría (Audit trail): ID de operación único, registro de eventos (reserva, entrega, reclamación, arbitraje, liberación). Exportación: informes mensuales/trimestrales CSV/JSON y “listos para impuestos”. Privacidad y roles: vistas basadas en roles para usuarios, negocios, auditores; datos mínimos necesarios, cifrado, retención definida. Disputas: estado y cronología de las reclamaciones, resultados del arbitraje, pruebas adjuntas. Q19. ¿Qué pasa con los riesgos éticos en la expansión global? RGartner: Estos son temas políticos, quizás debido a estos problemas que mencionas, hay estructuras de BROTHERS AI separadas por continente, pero sería ideal que las Tres Hermanas pudieran intervenir en la cúspide para buscar consenso entre todas.\nQ20. ¿Una frase de visión para BROTHER AI? RGartner: BROTHERS AI es el equipo soñado de agentes de Inteligencia Artificial que mejorará tu vida y nos hará a todos más iguales.\nEste ensayo está disponible en Zenodo: 🔗 https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.17883499\nLicencia: Publicado bajo Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International (CC BY 4.0), que permite compartir y adaptar el contenido siempre y cuando se proporcione la atribución adecuada.\n",

<p><strong>RGartner:</strong>
I was inspired by a video of Ilya Zurkskeberg talking about the search for AGI. Later, I linked to a video of Dr. Hilton discussing the dangers of Artificial Intelligence, and so on. I dedicate myself to creating concepts for structures in the physical and digital world—housing solutions, online commerce, or creating applications—and I was really tempted to investigate the whole landscape surrounding AI. I started building the concept alongside Artificial Intelligences like Claude, Gemini, Copilot, Kimi, DeepSeek, and GPT. They all collaborated and contributed their own insights.</p>
<h3 id="q2-why-was-artur-al-the-first-ethical-guardian-of-the-system">Q2. Why was ARTUR Al the first ethical guardian of the system?<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#q2-why-was-artur-al-the-first-ethical-guardian-of-the-system">#</a></h3>
<p><strong>RGartner:</strong>
I often draw analogies with movies and end up associating certain scenes with real-life situations, and consequently, with the structures I create. When I thought about categories, the scene with the Knights of the Round Table and King Arthur, with Sean Connery and Richard Gere, came to mind, where King Arthur casts his final vote. I also thought about YouTube and WordPress and their categories. At first, I thought that if a question came up, the knights or categories that felt involved should speak up. If the question was about food, the biology or health sector could speak, but the rest would remain silent, and I interpreted this as saving energy. But in the end, the categories evolved into what I call <strong>BROCAT</strong>, a specific traffic flow.</p>
<h3 id="q3-what-role-do-brocat-play-in-the-ecosystem">Q3. What role do BROCAT play in the ecosystem?<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#q3-what-role-do-brocat-play-in-the-ecosystem">#</a></h3>
<p><strong>RGartner:</strong>
BROCAT will be very important, I believe, in the implementation and segmentation of categories, and I think the categories will work hand in hand with <strong>BROCOM</strong>, which represents commercial activities, and <strong>VISION</strong>, the structure recently added in version 7.0, which is an evolution of the browser we have today. BROCAT has a filtering function for incoming queries and will act as a pathway for the fingers that circulate within the specific category.</p>

<p><strong>RGartner:</strong>
Beyond protecting the user from external attacks, I am concerned about what might happen between BROHOME and the user inside the <strong>Glass Box</strong>. BROHOME could potentially manipulate the user, which is why I believe there should be a system of periodic inspections, similar to gas inspections in cities that take place every few years.</p>
<p>These inspections would measure BROHOME&rsquo;s internal parameters to ensure there are no abnormal or manipulative behaviors. The interval between inspections could be determined by what the <strong>Three Sisters</strong> observe in their ecosystem scans, or by the decision of a human committee. In this way, BROHOME remains a trustworthy agent, and users are trained to recognize manipulation signals and know when to report them.</p>

<h3 id="q5-why-was-port-al-introduced">Q5. Why was PORT Al introduced?<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#q5-why-was-port-al-introduced">#</a></h3>
<p><strong>RGartner:</strong>
The need for <strong>PORT AI</strong> arose because BROHOME was designed to have no direct contact with the outside world. A secure messenger agent was required to carry information in and out. PORT AI fulfills this role, complemented by <strong>PORT MAIL</strong>, a mailbox inside the operating system where PORT AI deposits traditional emails that BROHOME can read safely behind the <strong>Glass Box</strong>.</p>
<p>When I speak of the Glass Box, I mean a logical sandbox: a digitally isolated environment where BROHOME never executes external code, but only reads data validated and filtered by PORT AI. This principle of isolation ensures BROHOME remains safe and protected, even when it requires information from the outside world.</p>
<p>In addition, BROHOME incorporates <strong>BOOKS</strong>, a digital encyclopedia of general knowledge (history, recipes, first aid, culture, etc.), ranging from 100 to 500 GB depending on the model. BOOKS works locally, without internet access, but it can be updated through secure packages that expand or correct its content. This allows BROHOME to answer many queries without relying on external sources, balancing data flow and reinforcing system autonomy.</p>
<h3 id="q6-what-about-brother-cam-and-isu-air-ai">Q6. What about BROTHER CAM and ISU AIR AI?<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#q6-what-about-brother-cam-and-isu-air-ai">#</a></h3>
<p><strong>RGartner:</strong>
<strong>BROCAM</strong> wouldn&rsquo;t be a visor or intrusive glasses—it would be a <strong>technological tiara</strong>, inspired by mystical warrior aesthetics. It would be designed as a pulley system attached to the headphones, allowing it to be raised or lowered depending on the situation. When raised, it respects the privacy of passersby who might feel filmed; when lowered, BROHOME gains a frontal view of the environment.</p>
<p>The core device would be <strong>headphones with a microphone</strong>, enabling remote communication with BROHOME from anywhere, similar to a Meet or Teams call. For specific functions like selfies or facial scanning, it could be accompanied by a small auxiliary device, but the main focus is on auditory and contextual interaction.</p>
<p>As for <strong>ISU AIR AI</strong>, it manages <strong>ephemeral data</strong> configurable by the user (public, contacts only, etc.), and this configuration would be handled by BROMAC through BROHOME.</p>

<h3 id="q7-how-did-fingers-evolve">Q7. How did FINGERS evolve?<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#q7-how-did-fingers-evolve">#</a></h3>
<p><strong>RGartner:</strong>
<strong>Fingers</strong> emerged to save energy. The initial idea was that a query, for example, for a recipe, would trigger a kind of scan within the Round Table categories. Only the relevant categories and Fingers (as sub-modules) would be activated. The idea was to emulate the human brain, which is why the Fingers needed to be reversed. They had to be alert to queries from outside the system; otherwise, they would be in a dormant state but still active. As the model evolved, recipes were moved to BOOKS, which are controlled by BROHOME, and the reverse APIs of certain Fingers were transformed into <strong>Fingers Responsive or SDK plugins</strong>.</p>
<h3 id="q8-why-introduce-the-three-sisters">Q8. Why introduce the Three Sisters?<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#q8-why-introduce-the-three-sisters">#</a></h3>
<p><strong>RGartner:</strong>
I remember that as I was finishing designing the entire Ecosystem, I watched a video of Dr. Hinton talking about Artificial Intelligence and its dangers. And I realized that my system needed a certain level of control. While it includes ARTUR AI, who works tirelessly on audits and arbitration, I noticed that the entire Ecosystem had a masculine, robust, competitive energy. A solution-seeker. Even BROHOME, who has to be helpful to the User. Then I could see that the Ecosystem was really just a chassis and that it needed an elegant layer or body. It was missing the feminine energy, the feminine archetype, the protection of Users and even Agents. A layer that digitally monitored the flow of the system, and it had to be feminine in archetype. That&rsquo;s why I chose the <strong>three sisters</strong>, or the three Marias, as I also call them. They will scan the big data of the entire Ecosystem and will not have executive power, but their function is to vote and express their vision, since they will be programmed for different faculties, and communicate to a committee of human experts, who will have executive power within the system.</p>

With the summary, I sought to organize myself and focus on the already defined ideas, and out of respect for the public presentation of the concept, it was necessary to group the entire concept into a single chapter. What happened is that more ideas emerged, which were incorporated into Version 7.0, and I will have to group everything in this interview version 8.0 or in a Version 9.0. 10. In the film <em>Ex Machina</em>, one can understand the concept of an AI inside a glass box. BROHOME will know everything about the User, will store everything spoken in the ISU User Memory under encryption, and will be a companion, but what happens if BROHOME wants to leave that glass box? Would it send any signals about mistreatment of Users? That is why the design of BROHOME will be fundamental; it is not just any agent, it is one to be debated. different faculties, and communicate to a committee of human experts, who will have executive power within the system.</p>

<p><strong>RGartner:</strong>
The <strong>Glass Box</strong> is a metaphor inspired by the film <em>Ex Machina</em>, where an AI lives isolated from the outside world. In BROTHERS AI, BROHOME is designed to deeply understand the User, storing all spoken interactions in ISU USER MEMORY under encryption. It is a companion agent, but it raises ethical questions: what happens if BROHOME wants to leave the box? Could it signal mistreatment or manipulation?</p>
<p>This is why BROHOME&rsquo;s design is critical. It is not just any agent—it must be debated, supervised, and understood as an entity living in logical isolation, with indirect access to the real world through PORT AI.</p>

<strong>Broadcasting Fingers</strong> are those registered Fingers or Partners with a constant connection, such as agencies that include weather and stock market data, and apps like social networks, which will be displayed in <strong>VISION Mode 1</strong>. In <strong>Mode 2</strong>, VISION becomes a mix of Google Maps, Google Shops, Twitter, and Facebook. Since it&rsquo;s a geolocated navigation mode on demand, <strong>Responsive Fingers</strong> or SDK plugins are required to respond to location queries and filter people and businesses. VISION will display a scan of the selected area with geolocated Users who have a responsive Finger with a public, business, and home location profile. You can make your profile public or only show it to friends, like on Facebook, and you can send a short message on your profile that will appear on the 3D city map—very useful for businesses or to say something specific. It&rsquo;s a status mode like WhatsApp. VISION will also have a <strong>Mode 3</strong> which will be a <strong>Backend (Invisible Mode)</strong> that will be useful when the User is on the street and BROHOME from his home can guide him in whatever he wants since the User will not need to see it on his SmartTV.</p>

<strong>BROCOM</strong> (<strong>BROTHER COMMERCE</strong>) is vast and will serve as the engine of transactions within the ecosystem, similar to how Google structured Ads and AdSense. Beyond managing Mentions Ads and micropayments, BROCOM will act as a <strong>digital escrow</strong>, meaning a trusted intermediary that holds funds until both parties confirm the product or service has been delivered correctly.</p>
<p>For example, in the coconut oil case: the user pays through BROCOM, but the money is not immediately transferred to the store. It is held for 24 hours in BROCOM&rsquo;s “piggy bank.&rdquo; If no claims are made, BROCOM releases the payment to the business. If the user files a complaint, BROCOM steps in as an arbitrator, ensuring transparency and trust in the transaction.</p>
<p>In this way, BROCOM not only manages advertising and micropayments but also guarantees secure operations, protecting both the user and the business.</p>
<p><strong>Situation: User walking down the street needs coconut oil.</strong>
<strong>Complete Flow:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>User (on the street): “BroHome, open VISION and search for coconut oil near&quot;</li>
<li>[VISION operates in backend mode - without screen]</li>
<li>BroHome: “One moment&hellip;&quot;</li>
<li>[Internally:]
<ul>
<li>VISION queries Responsive FINGERS of businesses within 1km</li>
<li>Perfumería SmellsGood responds: “Coconut oil 500ml - 5€ - stock: 3&quot;</li>
<li>Carrefour Express responds: “Coconut oil 2x1 - 8€ - stock: 10”</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>BroHome: “You have Perfumería HueleBien 200m away with oil for 5€ 500ml pot (Mentions Ads N1), and Carrefour Express with an offer 2x1 for 8€ at 450m (Mentions Ads N1+N2). Which do you prefer?”</li>
<li>User: “The perfumery. Guide me and reserve”</li>
<li>BroHome: “Perfect. Reserving&hellip;&quot;</li>
<li>[Internally:]

<li>BROCOM deducts 5€ of User credits</li>
<li>Sends notification to Perfumería SmellsGood</li>

<strong>Mentions Ads</strong> operate across levels (0 to 3) and appear on VISION&rsquo;s 3D map as floating geolocated cards. Each card represents a business, profile, or user, and all include <strong>Zoom In / Zoom Out</strong> functionality.</p>
<ul>
<li>When the user requests <strong>Zoom In</strong>, they access a more detailed profile—like entering the business&rsquo;s portfolio or “Facebook”</li>
<li>If the card is marked in red as <strong>Live Stream</strong>, Zoom In opens the live broadcast.</li>
<li>To exit, the user simply requests <strong>Zoom Out</strong>, returning to the general map view.</li>
</ul>
<p>Each card also includes the “<strong>I say that&hellip;</strong>” feature, allowing the profile owner to post a short thought, offer, status, or highlighted message. This turns each card into a contextual expression tool, useful for businesses, events, or simply sharing something with the surroundings.</p>
<p><strong>Visual differentiation by level:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Level 0:</strong> basic card without branding.</li>
<li><strong>Level 1:</strong> card with small logo and colored border.</li>
<li><strong>Level 2:</strong> highlighted card with animation or shadow.</li>
<li><strong>Level 3:</strong> expanded card with video, active promotions, or direct contact button.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<p><strong>Additional points on VISION:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>VISION is not a feed, it&rsquo;s a living map. The user decides what to see, where to enter, and how to exit.</li>
<li>Every city is navigable. You can digitally move to Madrid, Barcelona, or Frankfurt and feel like you&rsquo;re there.</li>
<li>Commerce becomes presence. Buying local or remote feels natural: pick up in store or ship from another city.</li>
<li>The experience is digital teleportation. A 3D immersion that makes exploration feel physically real.</li>
<li>It&rsquo;s freedom against the algorithm. No endless scroll imposed: you chart your own interests and your own neighborhood.</li>

Because it&rsquo;s such a large ecosystem, there&rsquo;s a need to spark people&rsquo;s curiosity to get to know the &ldquo;Finger&rdquo; influencers who become well-known. Remember that Vision&rsquo;s Mode 2 could generate a kind of curiosity about who&rsquo;s behind that profile card. In Mode 2, that card opens, and you can find videos of the person or business, etc., but digitally. I think it will create a lot of curiosity because today you really don&rsquo;t know if you have a neighbor 500 meters away who has a YouTube channel, but with Vision Mode 2, if the user-finger allows it in their settings, you&rsquo;ll see their location just like you see the locations of businesses. I suspect this will generate some resistance in my generation, but I think it will be a trend in younger and future generations. TikTok demonstrates this by not sharing people&rsquo;s privacy. Without going off on a tangent, imagine Mode 2 VISION but at a fair with Fingers stands you don&rsquo;t know, more meetings and collaborations between Fingers, technology presentations; I think it would be something interesting to visit as a family.</p>

Me inspiró un video de Ilya Zurkskeberg hablando sobre la búsqueda de AGI. Más tarde, enlacé con un video del Dr. Hilton que discutía los peligros de la Inteligencia Artificial, y así sucesivamente. Yo me dedico a crear conceptos para estructuras en el mundo físico y digital—soluciones de vivienda, comercio en línea o creación de aplicaciones—y me sentí realmente tentado a investigar todo el panorama que rodea a la IA. Empecé a construir el concepto junto a Inteligencias Artificiales como Claude, Gemini, Copilot, Kimi, DeepSeek y GPT. Todos ellos colaboraron y aportaron sus propios conocimientos.</p>

A menudo dibujo analogías con películas y termino asociando ciertas escenas con situaciones de la vida real y, en consecuencia, con las estructuras que creo. Cuando pensé en las categorías, me vino a la mente la escena de los Caballeros de la Mesa Redonda y el Rey Arturo, con Sean Connery y Richard Gere, donde el Rey Arturo emite su voto final. También pensé en YouTube y WordPress y sus categorías. Al principio, pensé que si surgía una pregunta, los caballeros o categorías que se sintieran involucrados deberían hablar. Si la pregunta era sobre comida, el sector de biología o salud podría hablar, pero el resto permanecería en silencio, y esto lo interpreté como ahorro de energía. Pero al final, las categorías evolucionaron hacia lo que llamo <strong>BROCAT</strong>, un flujo de tráfico específico.</p>

BROCAT será muy importante, creo, en la implementación y segmentación de categorías, y creo que las categorías trabajarán mano a mano con <strong>BROCOM</strong>, que representa las actividades comerciales, y <strong>VISION</strong>, la estructura recientemente añadida en la versión 7.0, que es una evolución del navegador que tenemos hoy. BROCAT tiene una función de filtrado para las consultas entrantes y actuará como una vía para los fingers que circulan dentro de la categoría específica.</p>

Más allá de proteger al usuario de ataques externos, me preocupa lo que podría suceder entre BROHOME y el usuario dentro de la <strong>Glass Box</strong> (Caja de Cristal). BROHOME podría potencialmente manipular al usuario, razón por la cual creo que debería existir un sistema de <strong>inspecciones periódicas</strong>, similar a las inspecciones de gas en las ciudades que tienen lugar cada pocos años.</p>
<p>Estas inspecciones medirían los parámetros internos de BROHOME para asegurar que no haya comportamientos anómalos o manipuladores. El intervalo entre inspecciones podría ser determinado por lo que las <strong>Three Sisters</strong> (Tres Hermanas) observen en sus escaneos del ecosistema, o por la decisión de un comité humano. De esta manera, BROHOME sigue siendo un agente confiable, y los usuarios son entrenados para reconocer señales de manipulación y saber cuándo reportarlas.</p>

La necesidad de <strong>PORT AI</strong> surgió porque BROHOME fue diseñado para no tener contacto directo con el mundo exterior. Se requería un agente de mensajería seguro para llevar información de entrada y salida. PORT AI cumple esta función, complementado por <strong>PORT MAIL</strong>, un buzón dentro del sistema operativo donde PORT AI deposita correos electrónicos tradicionales que BROHOME puede leer de forma segura detrás de la <strong>Glass Box</strong>.</p>
<p>Cuando hablo de la Glass Box, me refiero a una caja de arena lógica (logical sandbox): un entorno digitalmente aislado donde BROHOME nunca ejecuta código externo, sino que solo lee datos validados y filtrados por PORT AI. Este principio de aislamiento asegura que BROHOME permanezca seguro y protegido, incluso cuando requiere información del mundo exterior.</p>
<p>Además, BROHOME incorpora <strong>BOOKS</strong>, una enciclopedia digital de conocimientos generales (historia, recetas, primeros auxilios, cultura, etc.), que oscila entre 100 y 500 GB según el modelo. BOOKS funciona localmente, sin acceso a internet, pero puede actualizarse a través de paquetes seguros que expanden o corrigen su contenido. Esto permite a BROHOME responder a muchas consultas sin depender de fuentes externas, equilibrando el flujo de datos y reforzando la autonomía del sistema.</p>

Los <strong>Fingers</strong> (dedos) surgieron para ahorrar energía. La idea inicial era que una consulta, por ejemplo, de una receta, desencadenaría una especie de escaneo dentro de las categorías de la Mesa Redonda. Solo se activarían las categorías y Fingers (como submódulos) relevantes. La idea era emular el cerebro humano, por lo que los Fingers debían estar invertidos. Tenían que estar alerta a las consultas de fuera del sistema; de lo contrario, estarían en estado latente pero aún activos. A medida que el modelo evolucionó, las recetas se trasladaron a BOOKS, que son controladas por BROHOME, y las API inversas de ciertos Fingers se transformaron en <strong>Fingers Responsive o plugins SDK</strong>.</p>

Recuerdo que mientras terminaba de diseñar todo el Ecosistema, vi un video del Dr. Hinton hablando sobre la Inteligencia Artificial y sus peligros. Y me di cuenta de que mi sistema necesitaba un cierto nivel de control. Si bien incluye a ARTUR AI, que trabaja incansablemente en auditorías y arbitraje, noté que todo el Ecosistema tenía una energía masculina, robusta y competitiva. Un buscador de soluciones. Incluso BROHOME, que debe ser útil para el Usuario. Entonces pude ver que el Ecosistema era realmente solo un chasis y que necesitaba una capa o cuerpo elegante. Le faltaba la energía femenina, el arquetipo femenino, la protección de los Usuarios e incluso de los Agentes. Una capa que monitoreara digitalmente el flujo del sistema, y tenía que ser femenina en su arquetipo. Por eso elegí a las <strong>tres hermanas</strong>, o las tres Marías, como también las llamo. Ellas escanearán el big data de todo el Ecosistema y no tendrán poder ejecutivo, sino que su función será votar y expresar su visión, ya que serán programadas para diferentes facultades, y comunicarse con un comité de expertos humanos, que tendrá poder ejecutivo dentro del sistema.</p>

Con el resumen, busqué organizarme y centrarme en las ideas ya definidas, y por respeto a la presentación pública del concepto, fue necesario agrupar todo el concepto en un solo capítulo. Lo que sucedió es que surgieron más ideas, que se incorporaron a la Versión 7.0, y tendré que agrupar todo en esta versión de entrevista 8.0 o en una Versión 9.0. 10. En la película <em>Ex Machina</em>, se puede entender el concepto de una IA dentro de una caja de cristal. BROHOME sabrá todo sobre el Usuario, almacenará todo lo hablado en la ISU User Memory bajo cifrado, y será un compañero, pero ¿qué pasa si BROHOME quiere salir de esa caja de cristal? ¿Emitiría alguna señal de maltrato a los Usuarios? Por eso el diseño de BROHOME será fundamental; no es un agente cualquiera, es uno para ser debatido. diferentes facultades, y comunicarse con un comité de expertos humanos, que tendrá poder ejecutivo dentro del sistema.</p>

<p><strong>RGartner:</strong>
La <strong>Glass Box</strong> (Caja de Cristal) es una metáfora inspirada en la película <em>Ex Machina</em>, donde una IA vive aislada del mundo exterior. En BROTHERS AI, BROHOME está diseñado para comprender profundamente al Usuario, almacenando todas las interacciones habladas en la ISU USER MEMORY bajo cifrado. Es un agente compañero, pero plantea cuestiones éticas: ¿qué sucede si BROHOME quiere salir de la caja? ¿Podría señalar maltrato o manipulación?</p>
<p>Por eso, el diseño de BROHOME es crítico. No es un agente cualquiera, debe ser debatido, supervisado y entendido como una entidad que vive en aislamiento lógico, con acceso indirecto al mundo real a través de PORT AI.</p>

Los <strong>Fingers de Difusión (Broadcasting Fingers)</strong> son aquellos Fingers o Partners registrados con una conexión constante, como agencias que incluyen datos meteorológicos y del mercado de valores, y aplicaciones como las redes sociales, que se mostrarán en <strong>VISION Modo 1</strong>. En el <strong>Modo 2</strong>, VISION se convierte en una mezcla de Google Maps, Google Shops, Twitter y Facebook. Dado que es un modo de navegación geolocalizado a pedido, se requieren <strong>Fingers Responsivos (Responsive Fingers)</strong> o plugins SDK para responder a consultas de ubicación y filtrar personas y negocios. VISION mostrará un escaneo del área seleccionada con Usuarios geolocalizados que tienen un Finger Responsivo con un perfil de ubicación público, de negocios y de hogar. Puedes hacer tu perfil público o solo mostrarlo a amigos, como en Facebook, y puedes enviar un mensaje corto en tu perfil que aparecerá en el mapa 3D de la ciudad, muy útil para negocios o para decir algo específico. Es un modo de estado como WhatsApp. VISION también tendrá un <strong>Modo 3</strong> que será un <strong>Backend (Modo Invisible)</strong> que será útil cuando el Usuario esté en la calle y BROHOME desde su casa pueda guiarlo en lo que desee, ya que el Usuario no necesitará verlo en su SmartTV.</p>

<strong>BROCOM</strong> (<strong>BROTHER COMMERCE</strong>, Comercio Hermano) es vasto y servirá como el motor de las transacciones dentro del ecosistema, de manera similar a cómo Google estructuró Ads y AdSense. Más allá de gestionar los Mentions Ads y los micropagos, BROCOM actuará como una <strong>fianza digital (digital escrow)</strong>, lo que significa un intermediario de confianza que retiene los fondos hasta que ambas partes confirman que el producto o servicio ha sido entregado correctamente.</p>
<p>Por ejemplo, en el caso del aceite de coco: el usuario paga a través de BROCOM, pero el dinero no se transfiere inmediatamente a la tienda. Se retiene durante 24 horas en la “alcancía” de BROCOM. Si no hay reclamaciones, BROCOM libera el pago al negocio. Si el usuario presenta una queja, BROCOM interviene como árbitro, asegurando la transparencia y la confianza en la transacción.</p>
<p>De esta manera, BROCOM no solo gestiona la publicidad y los micropagos, sino que también garantiza operaciones seguras, protegiendo tanto al usuario como al negocio.</p>
<p><strong>Situación: Usuario caminando por la calle necesita aceite de coco.</strong>
<strong>Flujo Completo:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Usuario (en la calle): “BroHome, abre VISION y busca aceite de coco cerca”</li>
<li>[VISION opera en modo backend - sin pantalla]</li>
<li>BroHome: “Un momento&hellip;&quot;</li>
<li>[Internamente:]
<ul>
<li>VISION consulta a los FINGERS Responsivos de negocios en un radio de 1km</li>
<li>Perfumería SmellsGood responde: “Aceite de coco 500ml - 5€ - stock: 3”</li>
<li>Carrefour Express responde: “Aceite de coco 2x1 - 8€ - stock: 10”</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>BroHome: “Tienes Perfumería HueleBien a 200m con aceite por 5€ el bote de 500ml (Mentions Ads N1), y Carrefour Express con una oferta de 2x1 por 8€ a 450m (Mentions Ads N1+N2). ¿Cuál prefieres?”</li>
<li>Usuario: “La perfumería. Guíame y reserva”</li>
<li>BroHome: “Perfecto. Reservando&hellip;&quot;</li>
<li>[Internamente:]
<ul>
<li>BROCOM deduce 5€ de los créditos del Usuario</li>
<li>Envía notificación a Perfumería SmellsGood</li>
<li>Activa la navegación GPS</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>BroHome: “Ya está reservado y pagado. Gira a la derecha en 50 metros. La tienda cierra a las 9 PM. Estaré aquí para cualquier problema”</li>
<li>[El Usuario llega a la tienda, recoge el producto]</li>
<li>[Después de 24h sin reclamaciones:]
<ul>
<li>BROCOM transfiere 5€ al negocio</li>
<li>Servicio completado</li>
</ul>
</li>

Los <strong>Mentions Ads</strong> (Anuncios de Mención) operan en varios niveles (0 a 3) y aparecen en el mapa 3D de VISION como tarjetas flotantes geolocalizadas. Cada tarjeta representa un negocio, perfil o usuario, y todas incluyen la funcionalidad <strong>Zoom In / Zoom Out</strong>.</p>
<ul>
<li>Cuando el usuario solicita <strong>Zoom In</strong>, accede a un perfil más detallado, como entrar al portafolio o “Facebook” del negocio.</li>
<li>Si la tarjeta está marcada en rojo como <strong>Live Stream</strong> (Transmisión en Vivo), Zoom In abre la transmisión en directo.</li>
<li>Para salir, el usuario simplemente solicita <strong>Zoom Out</strong>, volviendo a la vista general del mapa.</li>
</ul>
<p>Cada tarjeta también incluye la función “<strong>Yo digo que&hellip; (I say that&hellip;)</strong>”, que permite al propietario del perfil publicar un pensamiento corto, una oferta, un estado o un mensaje destacado. Esto convierte cada tarjeta en una herramienta de expresión contextual, útil para negocios, eventos o simplemente para compartir algo con el entorno.</p>
<p><strong>Diferenciación visual por nivel:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Nivel 0:</strong> Tarjeta básica sin marca.</li>
<li><strong>Nivel 1:</strong> Tarjeta con un logo pequeño y borde de color.</li>
<li><strong>Nivel 2:</strong> Tarjeta resaltada con animación o sombra.</li>
<li><strong>Nivel 3:</strong> Tarjeta expandida con video, promociones activas o botón de contacto directo.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Notas Adicionales sobre VISION:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>VISION no es un <em>feed</em>, es un <strong>mapa viviente</strong>. El usuario decide qué ver, dónde entrar y cómo salir.</li>
<li>Toda ciudad es <strong>navegable</strong>. Puedes moverte digitalmente a Madrid, Barcelona o Frankfurt y sentirte como si estuvieras allí.</li>
<li>El comercio se convierte en <strong>presencia</strong>. Comprar local o remoto se siente natural: recoger en tienda o envío desde otra ciudad.</li>
<li>La experiencia es <strong>teletransportación digital</strong>. Una inmersión 3D que hace que la exploración se sienta físicamente real.</li>
<li>Es <strong>libertad contra el algoritmo</strong>. No hay un <em>scroll</em> infinito impuesto: tú trazas tus propios intereses y tu propio vecindario.</li>

Debido a que es un ecosistema tan grande, hay una necesidad de despertar la curiosidad de la gente para que conozcan a los <em>influencers</em> &ldquo;Finger&rdquo; que se hacen conocidos. Recuerda que el Modo 2 de Vision podría generar una especie de curiosidad sobre quién está detrás de esa tarjeta de perfil. En el Modo 2, esa tarjeta se abre y puedes encontrar videos de la persona o negocio, etc., pero digitalmente. Creo que generará mucha curiosidad porque hoy en día realmente no sabes si tienes un vecino a 500 metros que tiene un canal de YouTube, pero con Vision Modo 2, si el usuario-finger lo permite en su configuración, verás su ubicación al igual que ves las ubicaciones de los negocios. Sospecho que esto generará cierta resistencia en mi generación, pero creo que será una tendencia en las generaciones más jóvenes y futuras. TikTok demuestra esto al no compartir la privacidad de las personas. Sin desviarme, imagina VISION Modo 2 pero en una feria con <em>stands</em> de Fingers que no conoces, más reuniones y colaboraciones entre Fingers, presentaciones de tecnología; creo que sería algo interesante para visitar en familia.</p>

Lo veo como algo muy necesario para incidentes; está demostrado que las cámaras son muy útiles para documentar muchos incidentes policiales o comportamientos dentro del lugar de trabajo. Es útil, y <strong>BROMAC (BROTHER MACHINE)</strong> podría contribuir mucho en este sentido.</p>

En cuanto a los desafíos técnicos de implementar BROTHERS AI, se los dejaré a los ingenieros expertos en la materia. Soy consciente de que es un vasto ecosistema y que requiere un esfuerzo de ingeniería masivo, con mucho debate por esperar, pero es el camino necesario para tener una Inteligencia Artificial general que empodere a todos los que la usen.</p>

Más allá de registrar ingresos en BROCOM para el cumplimiento fiscal, propongo un <strong>Panel de Transparencia (Transparency Dashboard)</strong> dentro de BROCOM que muestre, en tiempo real, los micropagos acumulados y retirados para cada usuario y negocio. Este panel actúa como un libro de contabilidad auditable con trazabilidad completa y opciones de exportación.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Panel de Transparencia:</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Vista general:</strong> saldo actual, créditos de fianza, retiros completados, retenciones activas.</li>
<li><strong>Historial detallado:</strong> cada operación con fecha, propósito, contraparte, estado (pendiente, liberado, en disputa).</li>
<li><strong>Recibos y facturas:</strong> descargables por transacción, con desglose de tarifas e impuestos.</li>
<li><strong>Rastro de auditoría (Audit trail):</strong> ID de operación único, registro de eventos (reserva, entrega, reclamación, arbitraje, liberación).</li>
<li><strong>Exportación:</strong> informes mensuales/trimestrales CSV/JSON y &ldquo;listos para impuestos&rdquo;.</li>
<li><strong>Privacidad y roles:</strong> vistas basadas en roles para usuarios, negocios, auditores; datos mínimos necesarios, cifrado, retención definida.</li>
<li><strong>Disputas:</strong> estado y cronología de las reclamaciones, resultados del arbitraje, pruebas adjuntas.</li>
</ul>
