&lsquo;What is the Fediverse, Mastodon, and Decentralized Applications?
Servers
To understand the Fediverse, we first need to understand what a server is. Your server is much like a router; it has inputs and outputs to perform tasks. Your computer could be a server if you configure it a certain way. Imagine you have videos to share and want to do it from your home. If your computer is now a server, you could share those videos from your house. You would need to create a website with another computer using software like WordPress and connect it to your computer-server. With this system, the general public would visit that website, see thumbnails of your videos, click on one, and a signal would be sent to your computer-server. It receives this request as an input and, as an output, sends the video signal to the web for the public to see. Depending on bandwidth, this can take milliseconds, thanks to technological advances like 5G. Broadly speaking, this is a server: as its name implies, it provides a service of input and output for content like videos, audio, and all types of data.">

Servers To understand the Fediverse, we first need to understand what a server is. Your server is much like a router; it has inputs and outputs to perform tasks. Your computer could be a server if you configure it a certain way. Imagine you have videos to share and want to do it from your home. If your computer is now a server, you could share those videos from your house.

It receives this request as an input and, as an output, sends the video signal to the web for the public to see. Depending on bandwidth, this can take milliseconds, thanks to technological advances like 5G. Broadly speaking, this is a server: as its name implies, it provides a service of input and output for content like videos, audio, and all types of data.\nThis is an example of a personal server, which logically would need to be on 24/7 to respond to requests at any time. This system is generally used on a larger scale by private companies, which offer the famous web hosting services. These are essentially a large number of machines providing the service we described, but this time serving not just one website with a few videos, but thousands and thousands of websites from all over the world that want to use their server hosting.\nThere are much larger companies that offer more power and services, such as national telephone companies or international giants. Today, servers are even set up solely to handle the demands of artificial intelligence services.\nThe Fediverse Now that we have a general idea of how a server works, let’s talk about the Fediverse.\nThe Fediverse is an ecosystem of applications that, in turn, have channels called instances. The activity of each channel, or instance, is hosted on a server administered by a community, an individual, or a private company. So far, you could say this is similar to Discord, where you rent a server to host your community. But there’s a difference: all those servers belong to the company Discord, whereas in the Fediverse, everything is independent.\nIn the Fediverse, you have applications like Mastodon, which is similar to X (formerly Twitter), with independent channels or instances, each with its own servers and administrators. Unlike Twitter, where everything that happens ends up on Elon Musk’s servers (who, let’s remember, owns the company), Mastodon has so many channels and instances that the data can remain on the server of that specific channel or instance, or it can be cross-posted to other channels or instances on other servers. This depends on whether the administrators of these servers have decided to form a community of channels and servers where data is shared. This activity is called federation.\nThe ability to federate exists thanks to a special and innovative data protocol called ActivityPub, which allows for this data exchange. To give you a practical example: Imagine if YouTube and TikTok were federated. You “like” a video on YouTube, and that user would receive the notification within TikTok. You could follow someone from TikTok on your YouTube account. In today’s platforms, this doesn’t happen because they are closed systems by corporate decision. YouTube and TikTok cannot federate because they do not use ActivityPub.\nAnd this isn’t science fiction: in the Fediverse, this ALREADY works. You can follow a video creator on PeerTube from your Mastodon account, or comment on a Castopod podcast without leaving your favorite app. It’s like living in a neighborhood where all the houses have doors that open to each other, instead of everyone being locked in their own bunker. When you receive a notification on your mobile or PC, it’s because you have granted permissions on your device. This means that by approving notifications, you have initiated a form of federation between your device and the application you gave permissions to.\nWithin the Fediverse, it’s not just Mastodon with its ability to write posts, upload short audio clips, or share links like on Twitter. The Fediverse also has dedicated applications for videos, podcasts, etc., and they all share the unique feature of being able to federate with each other because they use the ActivityPub protocol. There’s PeerTube for videos and Castopod for uploading podcasts.\nThe Future of the Fediverse The Fediverse was supposedly built to combat the monopolies of large companies like Google, Microsoft, and Apple, which use our data for many things. However, there are many challenges ahead, and I have identified a couple of problems.\nOn one hand, while everything seems open and decentralized, many channels or instances remain closed. There are closed communities that, for their own reasons, do not open up to the general community. This digital elitism is manifested in the so-called “gatekeepers”: administrators who unilaterally decide which instances are worthy of federating with theirs, who can join their community, or what content is “worthy.”\nThere are instances that require “letters of introduction” to join, as if they were exclusive clubs. Others block entire instances over minor ideological differences, further fragmenting the ecosystem. Ironically, the Fediverse promises to free us from the algorithms of Zuckerberg and Musk, but now we have hundreds of little Zuckerbergs with their own digital kingdoms. In a way, this doesn’t align with the spirit of an open community.\nOn the other hand, while applications like Mastodon are quite friendly to newcomers, I’ve noticed a syndrome in Mastodon that can also be seen in a closed application like Substack. For those who don’t know it, Substack is a closed app, but it’s a place where many who enjoy writing leave their work for the public to read. What I detected in Substack is that everyone writes, but nobody reads anyone else. And if they read, they don’t comment, and if they don’t comment, we don’t know if they read it, if they read a little, or a lot, or perhaps they read but didn’t understand what the messenger wanted to say. In Substack, you get the feeling that people read you but move on. I feel something similar in Mastodon, and I hope it’s not as severe.\nIt’s probably because we receive so much information, in such quantity, and believe me, all information is valuable. We receive so much information that we don’t stop to be grateful for what we see, what we read, for that message sent to us from the other side. And if it helps at all, to give value to everything that comes our way, let’s learn to read between the lines, to understand what that text or note is really telling us, even if it seems banal or trivial.\nLet’s reverse the context. We spend a lot of time offline and away from everything. Let’s imagine we’re in a world completely alien to our society, let’s imagine we’re on the planet Mars. And it turns out we receive a message, or a Toot, as they call them on Mastodon. Imagine how valuable that Toot will be to us. Whether it’s a video, an audio, or a simple phrase, it makes you feel like you’re not alone and that there’s someone on the other side. We would consider it much more valuable, precisely because that Toot arrived at a time of loneliness and need, and therefore, we needed it. That’s why it’s important to position ourselves from this perspective to value everything that arrives, even if the intention on the other side is different.\nFinally, an uncomfortable question arises: If the Fediverse reproduces the same power dynamics it criticizes, isn’t it simply digital feudalism with better marketing? Or is there still hope for decentralization to fulfill its original promise?\nRGartner Essay\nDeutsch (Alemán) Was sind das Fediverse, Mastodon und dezentrale Anwendungen? Server Um das Fediverse zu verstehen, müssen wir zuerst verstehen, was ein Server ist. Ihr Server ist so etwas wie ein Router; er hat Ein- und Ausgänge, um Aufgaben auszuführen. Ihr Computer könnte ein Server sein, wenn Sie ihn entsprechend konfigurieren. Stellen Sie sich vor, Sie haben Videos, die Sie von zu Hause aus teilen möchten. Wenn Ihr Computer nun ein Server ist, könnten Sie diese Videos von dort aus teilen. Sie müssten eine Website mit einem anderen Computer über eine Software wie WordPress erstellen und sie mit Ihrem Computer-Server verbinden. Mit diesem System würde die Öffentlichkeit diese Website besuchen, Miniaturansichten Ihrer Videos sehen, klicken, und von dort würde das Signal an Ihren Computer-Server gesendet. Dieser empfängt die Anfrage als Eingang und sendet als Ausgang das Videosignal an das Web, damit die Öffentlichkeit es sehen kann. Dies kann dank technologischer Fortschritte wie 5G Millisekunden dauern. Im Großen und Ganzen ist das ein Server: Er bietet einen Dienst für die Ein- und Ausgabe von Inhalten wie Videos, Audiodaten und allen Arten von Daten.\nDies ist ein Beispiel für einen persönlichen Server, der logischerweise 24 Stunden am Tag eingeschaltet sein müsste, um jederzeit auf Anfragen reagieren zu können. Dieses System wird in der Regel in größerem Maßstab von privaten Unternehmen genutzt, die das berühmte Webhosting anbieten. Dabei handelt es sich im Grunde um eine große Anzahl von Maschinen, die den zuvor beschriebenen Dienst bereitstellen, diesmal jedoch nicht nur für eine Website mit einigen Videos, sondern für Tausende von Websites aus aller Welt. Es gibt weitaus größere Unternehmen, die mehr Leistung und Dienstleistungen anbieten, wie nationale Telefongesellschaften oder internationale Riesen. Heutzutage werden Server sogar ausschließlich zur Deckung der Nachfrage nach Diensten der künstlichen Intelligenz eingerichtet.\nDas Fediverse Nachdem wir nun eine allgemeine Vorstellung davon haben, wie ein Server funktioniert, sprechen wir über das Fediverse. Das Fediverse ist ein Ökosystem von Anwendungen, die wiederum Kanäle haben, die als Instanzen bezeichnet werden. Die Aktivität jedes Kanals oder jeder Instanz wird auf einem Server gehostet, der von einer Gemeinschaft, einer Einzelperson oder einem privaten Unternehmen verwaltet wird. Man könnte sagen, das ist ähnlich wie bei Discord, wo man einen Server mietet, um seine Community zu beherbergen. Der Unterschied besteht jedoch darin, dass all diese Server dem Unternehmen Discord gehören, während im Fediverse alles unabhängig ist.\nIm Fediverse gibt es Anwendungen wie Mastodon, das X (ehemals Twitter) ähnelt, mit unabhängigen Kanälen oder Instanzen, die jeweils über eigene Server und Administratoren verfügen. Im Gegensatz zu Twitter, wo alles auf den Servern von Elon Musk landet, gibt es bei Mastodon so viele Kanäle und Instanzen, dass die Daten auf dem Server des jeweiligen Kanals verbleiben oder auch auf andere Kanäle mit anderen Servern übertragen werden können. Dies hängt davon ab, ob die Administratoren dieser Server beschlossen haben, eine Gemeinschaft von Kanälen und Servern zu bilden, in der Daten geteilt werden. Diese Aktivität wird Föderation genannt.\nDie Möglichkeit zur Föderation besteht dank eines innovativen Datenprotokolls namens ActivityPub. Ein praktisches Beispiel: Stellen Sie sich vor, YouTube und TikTok wären föderiert. Sie geben einem Video auf YouTube ein “Gefällt mir”, und der Nutzer würde die Benachrichtigung in TikTok erhalten. Sie könnten jemandem von TikTok über Ihr YouTube-Konto folgen. Auf den heutigen Plattformen geschieht dies nicht, da es sich um geschlossene Systeme handelt. YouTube und TikTok können nicht föderieren, weil sie ActivityPub nicht verwenden.\nUnd das ist keine Science-Fiction: Im Fediverse funktioniert das BEREITS so. Sie können einem Videoersteller auf PeerTube von Ihrem Mastodon-Konto aus folgen oder einen Podcast auf Castopod kommentieren, ohne Ihre Lieblings-App zu verlassen. Es ist, als ob man in einer Nachbarschaft lebt, in der alle Häuser offene Türen haben, anstatt dass jeder in seinem Bunker eingesperrt ist.\nIm Fediverse gibt es nicht nur Mastodon mit seinen Möglichkeiten, Beiträge zu schreiben oder Links zu teilen. Es gibt auch spezielle Anwendungen für Videos, Podcasts usw., die alle die Besonderheit haben, sich untereinander föderieren zu können, weil sie das ActivityPub-Protokoll verwenden. Es gibt PeerTube für Videos und Castopod für Podcasts.\nDie Zukunft des Fediverse Das Fediverse wurde angeblich gebaut, um die Monopole großer Unternehmen wie Google, Microsoft und Apple zu bekämpfen. Es gibt jedoch viele Herausforderungen, und ich habe einige Probleme festgestellt.\nEinerseits bleiben viele Kanäle oder Instanzen geschlossen, obwohl alles offen und dezentral erscheint. Es gibt geschlossene Gemeinschaften, die sich aus eigenen Gründen nicht der allgemeinen Gemeinschaft öffnen. Dieser digitale Elitismus zeigt sich in den sogenannten “Gatekeepern”: Administratoren, die einseitig entscheiden, welche Instanzen es wert sind, sich mit ihrer zu föderieren, wer ihrer Gemeinschaft beitreten darf oder welche Inhalte “würdig” sind.\nEs gibt Instanzen, die “Vorstellungsbriefe” verlangen, als wären sie exklusive Clubs. Andere blockieren ganze Instanzen wegen geringfügiger ideologischer Differenzen, was das Ökosystem weiter fragmentiert. Ironischerweise verspricht das Fediverse, uns von den Algorithmen von Zuckerberg und Musk zu befreien, aber jetzt haben wir Hunderte kleiner Zuckerbergs mit ihren eigenen digitalen Königreichen.\nAndererseits habe ich bei Mastodon ein Syndrom beobachtet, das auch in einer geschlossenen Anwendung wie Substack zu finden ist. Bei Substack habe ich festgestellt, dass jeder schreibt, aber niemand liest. Und wenn sie lesen, kommentieren sie nicht. Man hat das Gefühl, dass die Leute einen lesen, aber einfach weiterziehen. Ähnliches empfinde ich bei Mastodon.\nDas liegt wahrscheinlich daran, dass wir so viele Informationen in so großer Menge erhalten, und glauben Sie mir, jede Information ist wertvoll. Wir erhalten so viele Informationen, dass wir nicht innehalten, um dankbar zu sein für das, was wir sehen, was wir lesen, für die Nachricht, die uns von der anderen Seite geschickt wird. Und wenn es überhaupt hilft, allem, was uns begegnet, einen Wert beizumessen, dann lasst uns lernen, zwischen den Zeilen zu lesen, zu verstehen, was uns dieser Text oder diese Nachricht wirklich sagen will, selbst wenn sie banal oder trivial erscheint.\nDrehen wir den Kontext um. Wir verbringen viel Zeit offline und fernab von allem. Stellen wir uns vor, wir befinden uns in einer unserer Gesellschaft völlig fremden Welt, stellen wir uns vor, wir sind auf dem Planeten Mars. Und es stellt sich heraus, dass wir eine Nachricht erhalten, oder einen Toot, wie sie auf Mastodon genannt werden. Stellen Sie sich vor, wie wertvoll dieser Toot für uns sein wird. Ob Video, Audio oder ein einfacher Satz – er gibt Ihnen das Gefühl, nicht allein zu sein und dass da jemand auf der anderen Seite ist. Wir würden es als viel wertvoller erachten, gerade weil Toot in einer Zeit der Einsamkeit und Not ankam und wir es deshalb brauchten. Deshalb ist es wichtig, uns aus dieser Perspektive zu positionieren, um alles wertzuschätzen, was ankommt, auch wenn die Absicht auf der anderen Seite eine andere ist.\nSchließlich stellt sich eine unangenehme Frage: Wenn das Fediverse dieselben Machtdynamiken reproduziert, die es kritisiert, handelt es sich dann nicht einfach um digitalen Feudalismus mit besserer Vermarktung? Oder besteht noch Hoffnung, dass die Dezentralisierung ihr ursprüngliches Versprechen einlöst?\nRGartner-Aufsatz\nEspañol ¿Qué es el Fediverso, Mastodon y las aplicaciones descentralizadas? Servidores Para entender el Fediverso tenemos que entender qué es un servidor. Tu servidor es lo más parecido a un router, que contiene entradas y salidas para hacer cosas. Tu computadora podría ser un servidor si la configuras de cierta manera. Imaginemos que tienes unos videos para compartir y quieres hacerlo desde tu casa. Si tu computadora ahora es un servidor podrías compartir desde tu casa esos videos. Tendrías que crear una web con otra computadora a través de software como WordPress u otros y conectar a tu computadora-servidor. Con este sistema, el público general irá a esa web donde habrá unas miniaturas de tus videos, daría clic, y de ahí se envía la señal a tu computadora-servidor que recibe esa petición en su entrada, y en su salida envía la señal de tu video a la web para que el público lo vea. Esto, dependiendo del ancho de banda de la velocidad de las conexiones puede durar milisegundos gracias a los avances tecnológicos como el 5g. A grandes rasgos esto es un servidor, que como su nombre lo indica, da un servicio de entrada y salida de contenidos, como videos, audios y todo tipo de datos.\nEste ejemplo es de un servidor personal, que por lógica tendría que estar encendido las 24 horas para responder las peticiones en cualquier momento. Este sistema generalmente se usa en una mayor escala, con empresas privadas, que son precisamente las que ofrecen los famosos hostings o alojamiento de webs, que en realidad son una cantidad de máquinas que están dando el servicio que describimos anteriormente, pero esta vez dando servicio no solo a una web con unos videos, sino que dan servicio a miles y miles de webs de todo el mundo que quieran utilizar los alojamientos en esos servidores.\nHay empresas mucho más grandes que ofrecen más potencia y más servicios como las telefónicas nacionales o empresas gigantes a nivel internacional. Hasta hoy en día se montan servidores únicamente para atender las demandas de servicios de inteligencia artificial.\nFediverso Una vez que sabemos cómo funciona un servidor en líneas generales, hablemos del Fediverso. El Fediverso es un ecosistema donde hay aplicaciones que a su vez tienen canales, que se llaman instancias. La actividad de cada canal o instancia, está alojada en un servidor que es administrado por una comunidad o una persona o empresa privada. Hasta aquí podría decirse que esta actividad es similar a Discord donde contratas un servidor para llevar a tu comunidad ahí. Pero hay una diferencia, y está en que todos esos servidores, pertenecen a la empresa Discord mientras que en el Fediverso es algo independiente.\nEn el Fediverso tienes aplicaciones como Mastodon que es un símil a X (Ex Twitter) donde hay canales o instancias con sus servidores y administradores independientes. A diferencia de Twitter, donde todo lo que sucede, va a parar a los servidores de Elon Musk, que recordemos, es el dueño de esa empresa, en Mastodon hay tantos canales e instancias que los datos pueden mantenerse en el servidor del canal o instancia, o también se pueden cruzar a otros canales o instancias que tienen otros servidores. Y esto dependerá si entre los administradores de estos servidores han decidido armar una comunidad de canales y servidores, donde se comparten datos, donde a esta actividad se le llama federarse.\nLa posibilidad de federarse existe gracias a un protocolo especial de datos innovador, llamado ActivityPub, que permite esta actividad de cruce de datos. Para darte un ejemplo y un caso práctico: Imagina que YouTube y TikTok estuvieran federadas. Le das “me gusta” a un video en YouTube y ese usuario recibiría la notificación dentro de TikTok. Podrías seguir a alguien de TikTok desde tu cuenta de YouTube. Esto, en las plataformas actuales, no sucede porque son sistemas cerrados por decisión empresarial. YouTube y TikTok no pueden federarse porque no usan ActivityPub.\nY esto no es ciencia ficción: en el Fediverso YA funciona así. Puedes seguir a un creador de videos en PeerTube desde tu cuenta de Mastodon, o comentar un podcast de Castopod sin salir de tu aplicación favorita. Es como si vivieras en un barrio donde todas las casas tienen puertas que se abren entre sí, en lugar de estar cada uno encerrado en su búnker. Cuando recibes una notificación en tu móvil o PC, es porque has otorgado permisos dentro de un dispositivo. Esto quiere decir que tú, al aprobar las notificaciones en tu dispositivo has iniciado una especie de federación entre tu dispositivo y la aplicación donde le has dado los permisos.\nDentro del Fediverso no solo está Mastodon con todas sus posibilidades, puedes escribir post, subir pequeños audios, o colocar enlaces como en Twitter. También en el Fediverso hay aplicaciones exclusivas para videos, podcast etc., y todas tienen la particularidad de poder federarse entre sí porque usan el protocolo ActivityPub que comentamos anteriormente. Está PeerTube para videos y Castopod para subir podcasts.\nFuturo del Fediverso El Fediverso dicen que fue construido para combatir precisamente los monopolios de las grandes empresas como Google, Microsoft, Apple, donde utilizan nuestros datos para muchas cosas. No obstante hay muchos desafíos por delante, ya que he detectado un par de problemas.\nPor un lado, si bien todo parece abierto y descentralizado, muchos canales o instancias se mantienen cerradas. Hay comunidades cerradas que por sus particulares motivos no se abren a la comunidad en general. Este elitismo digital se manifiesta en los llamados “gatekeepers” o guardianes de acceso: administradores que deciden unilateralmente qué instancias merecen federarse con la suya, quién puede entrar a su comunidad, o qué contenidos son “dignos”.\nHay instancias que exigen “cartas de presentación” para unirte, como si fueran clubes exclusivos. Otras bloquean instancias completas por diferencias ideológicas menores, fragmentando aún más el ecosistema. Irónicamente, el Fediverso promete librarnos de los algoritmos de Zuckerberg y Musk, pero ahora tenemos cientos de pequeños Zuckerbergs con sus propios reinos digitales. Y en cierto modo, esto no va de la mano con el espíritu de comunidad abierta ciertamente.\nPor el otro lado, si bien las aplicaciones como Mastodon ya son bastante amigables con los recién llegados, al menos en Mastodon he visto un síndrome que también puede detectarse en una aplicación cerrada como Substack. Para los que no la conocen, Substack es una aplicación de las cerradas, pero es un sitio donde muchos que gustan de escribir dejan sus trabajos y notas para que el público lea sus pensamientos. Y lo que detecté en Substack es que todo el mundo escribe, pero nadie lee al otro, y si lee, no comenta, y si no comenta, no sabemos si leyó, si leyó poco, o si leyó mucho, o quizás leyó pero no entendió lo que quería decir el mensajero. En Substack tienes la sensación de que te leen pero pasan de largo. Algo parecido siento en Mastodon, y espero que no sea tan grave.\nPosiblemente se deba a que, recibimos tanta información, en tanta cantidad, y créanme, toda información es valiosa. Recibimos tanta información que no nos paramos a agradecer por eso que vemos, que leemos, por ese mensaje que nos mandan del otro lado. Y si de algo les sirve, para dar valor a todo lo que llegue, aprendamos a leer entre líneas, para comprender qué es lo que realmente nos dice ese texto o nota, aunque nos parezca banal o trivial.\nPongamos el contexto a la inversa. Nos encontramos durante mucho tiempo sin conexión y alejados de todo. Imaginemos que estamos en un mundo completamente ajeno a nuestra sociedad, imaginemos que estamos en el planeta Marte. Y resulta que recibimos un mensaje, o un Toot, así como los llaman en Mastodon. Imagina, qué valioso será ese Toot para nosotros. Ya sea un video, un audio, o una simple frase, que te haga sentir que no estás solo y que hay alguien al otro lado. Lo consideraríamos mucho más valioso, precisamente porque ese Toot, llegó en un momento de soledad y carencia, y por ende, lo necesitábamos. Por eso es importante posicionarnos desde esta perspectiva para dar valor a todo lo que llegue, por más que la intención que haya del otro lado, sea otra.\nPor último me surge una pregunta incómoda: Si el Fediverso reproduce las mismas dinámicas de poder que critica, ¿no es simplemente feudalismo digital con mejor marketing? ¿O todavía hay esperanza de que la descentralización cumpla su promesa original?\nEnsayo RGartner\nFrançais Qu’est-ce que le Fediverse, Mastodon et les applications décentralisées ? Serveurs Pour comprendre le Fediverse, il faut d’abord comprendre ce qu’est un serveur. Votre serveur ressemble beaucoup à un routeur ; il a des entrées et des sorties pour effectuer des tâches. Votre ordinateur pourrait être un serveur si vous le configurez d’une certaine manière. Imaginons que vous ayez des vidéos à partager et que vous vouliez le faire depuis chez vous. Si votre ordinateur est maintenant un serveur, vous pourriez partager ces vidéos depuis votre maison. Vous devriez créer un site web avec un autre ordinateur via un logiciel comme WordPress et le connecter à votre ordinateur-serveur. Avec ce système, le public visiterait ce site, verrait des miniatures de vos vidéos, cliquerait, et de là, le signal serait envoyé à votre ordinateur-serveur. Celui-ci reçoit la requête en entrée et, en sortie, envoie le signal de votre vidéo au web pour que le public puisse la voir. Cela peut prendre des millisecondes grâce aux avancées technologiques comme la 5G. En bref, c’est un serveur : il fournit un service d’entrée et de sortie pour des contenus comme les vidéos, l’audio et toutes sortes de données.\nCeci est un exemple de serveur personnel, qui devrait logiquement être allumé 24h/24. Ce système est généralement utilisé à plus grande échelle par des entreprises privées qui proposent les fameux services d’hébergement web. Ce sont essentiellement un grand nombre de machines qui fournissent le service décrit précédemment, mais cette fois-ci non pas à un seul site, mais à des milliers de sites web du monde entier.\nIl existe des entreprises beaucoup plus grandes qui offrent plus de puissance et de services. Aujourd’hui, des serveurs sont même mis en place uniquement pour répondre aux demandes des services d’intelligence artificielle.\nLe Fediverse Maintenant que nous savons comment fonctionne un serveur, parlons du Fediverse. Le Fediverse est un écosystème d’applications qui ont à leur tour des canaux, appelés instances. L’activité de chaque instance est hébergée sur un serveur administré par une communauté, une personne ou une entreprise privée. On pourrait dire que c’est similaire à Discord, où l’on loue un serveur pour sa communauté. Mais il y a une différence : tous ces serveurs appartiennent à Discord, alors que dans le Fediverse, tout est indépendant.\nDans le Fediverse, vous avez des applications comme Mastodon, qui est similaire à X (anciennement Twitter), avec des canaux ou des instances indépendants, chacun avec ses propres serveurs et administrateurs. Contrairement à Twitter, où tout finit sur les serveurs d’Elon Musk, sur Mastodon, les données peuvent rester sur le serveur de l’instance ou être partagées avec d’autres instances sur d’autres serveurs. Cela dépend si les administrateurs ont décidé de former une communauté de canaux où les données sont partagées. Cette activité s’appelle la fédération.\nLa possibilité de se fédérer existe grâce à un protocole de données innovant appelé ActivityPub. Pour vous donner un exemple pratique : imaginez que YouTube et TikTok soient fédérés. Vous “aimez” une vidéo sur YouTube, et cet utilisateur recevrait la notification dans TikTok. Vous pourriez suivre quelqu’un de TikTok depuis votre compte YouTube. Sur les plateformes actuelles, cela n’arrive pas car ce sont des systèmes fermés. YouTube et TikTok ne peuvent pas se fédérer car ils n’utilisent pas ActivityPub.\nEt ce n’est pas de la science-fiction : dans le Fediverse, cela fonctionne DÉJÀ. Vous pouvez suivre un créateur de vidéos sur PeerTube depuis votre compte Mastodon, ou commenter un podcast sur Castopod sans quitter votre application. C’est comme vivre dans un quartier où toutes les maisons ont des portes qui s’ouvrent les unes aux autres, au lieu d’être enfermé dans son bunker.\nDans le Fediverse, il n’y a pas que Mastodon. Il existe également des applications dédiées pour les vidéos, les podcasts, etc., qui peuvent toutes se fédérer entre elles car elles utilisent le protocole ActivityPub. Il y a PeerTube pour les vidéos et Castopod pour les podcasts.\nL’avenir du Fediverse Le Fediverse a été conçu pour lutter contre les monopoles des grandes entreprises comme Google, Microsoft et Apple. Cependant, il y a de nombreux défis à relever, et j’ai identifié quelques problèmes.\nD’une part, bien que tout semble ouvert et décentralisé, de nombreuses instances restent fermées. Il existe des communautés fermées qui ne s’ouvrent pas à la communauté générale. Cet élitisme numérique se manifeste par les “gardiens” (gatekeepers) : des administrateurs qui décident unilatéralement quelles instances méritent de se fédérer avec la leur, qui peut rejoindre leur communauté ou quels contenus sont “dignes”.\nCertaines instances exigent des “lettres de motivation”, comme s’il s’agissait de clubs exclusifs. D’autres bloquent des instances entières pour des divergences idéologiques mineures, fragmentant davantage l’écosystème. Ironiquement, le Fediverse promet de nous libérer des algorithmes de Zuckerberg et Musk, mais nous avons maintenant des centaines de petits Zuckerbergs avec leurs propres royaumes numériques.\nD’autre part, j’ai remarqué sur Mastodon un syndrome que l’on retrouve également sur une application fermée comme Substack. Sur Substack, j’ai détecté que tout le monde écrit, mais personne ne lit les autres. Et s’ils lisent, ils ne commentent pas. On a l’impression que les gens vous lisent mais passent à autre chose. Je ressens quelque chose de similaire sur Mastodon.\nC’est probablement parce que nous recevons tellement d’informations, en telle quantité, et croyez-moi, toute information est précieuse. Nous recevons tellement d’informations que nous ne prenons pas le temps d’être reconnaissants pour ce que nous voyons, ce que nous lisons, pour ce message qui nous est envoyé de l’autre côté. Et si cela peut nous aider, pour valoriser tout ce qui nous arrive, apprenons à lire entre les lignes, à comprendre ce que ce texte ou ce message nous dit vraiment, même s’il semble banal ou trivial.\nInversons le contexte. Nous passons beaucoup de temps hors ligne et loin de tout. Imaginons que nous soyons dans un monde complètement étranger à notre société, imaginons que nous soyons sur la planète Mars. Et il se trouve que nous recevons un message, ou un « tut », comme on les appelle sur Mastodon. Imaginez la valeur que ce « tut » aura pour nous. Qu’il s’agisse d’une vidéo, d’un audio ou d’une simple phrase, il nous donne le sentiment de ne pas être seul et qu’il y a quelqu’un de l’autre côté. Nous le considérerions comme bien plus précieux, précisément parce que ce Toot est arrivé à un moment de solitude et de besoin, et que, par conséquent, nous en avions besoin. C’est pourquoi il est important de se positionner dans cette perspective pour valoriser tout ce qui arrive, même si l’intention de l’autre partie est différente.\nEnfin, une question délicate se pose : si le Fediverse reproduit les mêmes dynamiques de pouvoir qu’il critique, ne s’agit-il pas simplement d’un féodalisme numérique avec un marketing plus efficace ? Ou peut-on encore espérer que la décentralisation tienne ses promesses initiales ?\nEssai de RGartner\nItaliano Cos’è il Fediverso, Mastodon e le applicazioni decentralizzate? Server Per capire il Fediverso, dobbiamo prima capire cos’è un server. Un server è molto simile a un router; ha input e output per eseguire compiti. Il tuo computer potrebbe essere un server se lo configuri in un certo modo. Immagina di avere dei video da condividere da casa tua. Se il tuo computer è ora un server, potresti condividere quei video. Dovresti creare un sito web con un altro computer tramite un software come WordPress e collegarlo al tuo computer-server. Con questo sistema, il pubblico visiterebbe quel sito, vedrebbe le miniature dei tuoi video, farebbe clic, e da lì il segnale verrebbe inviato al tuo computer-server. Questo riceve la richiesta come input e, come output, invia il segnale del tuo video al web affinché il pubblico lo veda. Questo processo può durare millisecondi grazie a progressi tecnologici come il 5G. In linea generale, questo è un server: fornisce un servizio di input e output per contenuti come video, audio e dati di ogni tipo.\nQuesto è un esempio di un server personale, che logicamente dovrebbe rimanere acceso 24 ore su 24. Questo sistema è generalmente utilizzato su scala più ampia da aziende private che offrono i famosi servizi di hosting web. Si tratta essenzialmente di un gran numero di macchine che forniscono il servizio descritto, ma questa volta non solo per un sito con alcuni video, ma per migliaia di siti web in tutto il mondo.\nCi sono aziende molto più grandi che offrono più potenza e servizi. Oggi, i server vengono persino allestiti esclusivamente per soddisfare le esigenze dei servizi di intelligenza artificiale.\nIl Fediverso Ora che abbiamo un’idea di come funziona un server, parliamo del Fediverso.\nIl Fediverso è un ecosistema di applicazioni che a loro volta hanno canali, chiamati istanze. L’attività di ogni istanza è ospitata su un server gestito da una comunità, una persona o un’azienda privata. Si potrebbe dire che sia simile a Discord, dove si affitta un server per la propria comunità. Ma c’è una differenza: tutti quei server appartengono a Discord, mentre nel Fediverso tutto è indipendente. Nel Fediverso, ci sono applicazioni come Mastodon, che è simile a X (ex Twitter), con canali o istanze indipendenti, ognuna con i propri server e amministratori. A differenza di Twitter, dove tutto finisce sui server di Elon Musk, su Mastodon i dati possono rimanere sul server di quella specifica istanza o essere condivisi con altre istanze su altri server. Questo dipende dal fatto che gli amministratori abbiano deciso di formare una comunità di canali dove i dati vengono condivisi. Questa attività è chiamata federazione.\nLa possibilità di federarsi esiste grazie a un protocollo di dati innovativo chiamato ActivityPub. Per fare un esempio pratico: immagina se YouTube e TikTok fossero federati. Metti “mi piace” a un video su YouTube e quell’utente riceverebbe la notifica su TikTok. Potresti seguire qualcuno di TikTok dal tuo account YouTube. Nelle piattaforme attuali, questo non accade perché sono sistemi chiusi. YouTube e TikTok non possono federarsi perché non usano ActivityPub.\nE questa non è fantascienza: nel Fediverso FUNZIONA GIÀ così. Puoi seguire un creatore di video su PeerTube dal tuo account Mastodon, o commentare un podcast su Castopod senza lasciare la tua app preferita. È come vivere in un quartiere dove tutte le case hanno porte che si aprono l’una all’altra, invece di essere chiusi nel proprio bunker.\nAll’interno del Fediverso non c’è solo Mastodon. Ci sono anche applicazioni dedicate per video, podcast, ecc., che possono tutte federarsi tra loro perché usano il protocollo ActivityPub. C’è PeerTube per i video e Castopod per i podcast.\nIl Futuro del Fediverso Il Fediverso è stato costruito per combattere i monopoli di grandi aziende come Google, Microsoft e Apple. Tuttavia, ci sono molte sfide da affrontare, e ho individuato un paio di problemi.\nDa un lato, anche se tutto sembra aperto e decentralizzato, molte istanze rimangono chiuse. Ci sono comunità chiuse che non si aprono alla comunità generale. Questo elitismo digitale si manifesta nei cosiddetti “gatekeeper”: amministratori che decidono unilateralmente quali istanze meritano di federarsi con la loro, chi può entrare nella loro comunità o quali contenuti sono “degni”. Ci sono istanze che richiedono “lettere di presentazione”, come se fossero club esclusivi. Altre bloccano intere istanze per piccole divergenze ideologiche, frammentando ulteriormente l’ecosistema. Ironicamente, il Fediverso promette di liberarci dagli algoritmi di Zuckerberg e Musk, ma ora abbiamo centinaia di piccoli Zuckerberg con i loro regni digitali.\nDall’altro lato, ho notato in Mastodon una sindrome che si può riscontrare anche in un’applicazione chiusa come Substack. Su Substack, ho notato che tutti scrivono, ma nessuno legge gli altri. E se leggono, non commentano. Si ha la sensazione che le persone ti leggano ma passino oltre. Provo una sensazione simile su Mastodon.\nProbabilmente è perché riceviamo così tante informazioni, in così grande quantità, e credetemi, tutte le informazioni sono preziose. Riceviamo così tante informazioni che non ci fermiamo ad essere grati per ciò che vediamo, per ciò che leggiamo, per quel messaggio che ci viene inviato dall’aldilà. E se può essere d’aiuto, per dare valore a tutto ciò che ci capita, impariamo a leggere tra le righe, a capire cosa ci sta realmente dicendo quel testo o quella nota, anche se sembra banale o banale.\nInvertiamo il contesto. Passiamo molto tempo offline e lontani da tutto. Immaginiamo di essere in un mondo completamente estraneo alla nostra società, immaginiamo di essere sul pianeta Marte. E scopriamo di ricevere un messaggio, o un Toot, come lo chiamano su Mastodon. Immaginate quanto prezioso sarà per noi quel Toot. Che si tratti di un video, di un audio o di una semplice frase, vi fa sentire come se non foste soli e che ci sia qualcuno dall’altra parte. Lo considereremmo molto più prezioso, proprio perché quel Toot è arrivato in un momento di solitudine e bisogno, e quindi ne avevamo bisogno. Ecco perché è importante posizionarci da questa prospettiva per dare valore a tutto ciò che arriva, anche se l’intenzione dall’altra parte è diversa.\nInfine, sorge una domanda scomoda: se il Fediverso riproduce le stesse dinamiche di potere che critica, non si tratta semplicemente di feudalesimo digitale con un marketing migliore? O c’è ancora speranza che la decentralizzazione mantenga la sua promessa originale?\nSaggio di RGartner\nPortuguês O que é o Fediverso, o Mastodon e as aplicações descentralizadas? Servidores Para entender o Fediverso, primeiro precisamos entender o que é um servidor. O seu servidor é muito parecido com um router; ele tem entradas e saídas para realizar tarefas. O seu computador poderia ser um servidor se o configurasse de uma certa maneira.\nImagine que você tem vídeos para partilhar e quer fazê-lo a partir de casa. Se o seu computador for agora um servidor, você poderia partilhar esses vídeos de sua casa. Teria de criar um site com outro computador através de um software como o WordPress e conectá-lo ao seu computador-servidor. Com este sistema, o público em geral iria a esse site, veria miniaturas dos seus vídeos, clicaria, e a partir daí o sinal seria enviado para o seu computador-servidor. Este recebe o pedido como entrada e, como saída, envia o sinal do seu vídeo para a web para que o público o veja. Dependendo da largura de banda, isto pode demorar milissegundos, graças a avanços tecnológicos como o 5G. Em termos gerais, isto é um servidor: ele fornece um serviço de entrada e saída para conteúdos como vídeos, áudios e todos os tipos de dados.\nEste é um exemplo de um servidor pessoal, que logicamente teria de estar ligado 24 horas por dia. Este sistema é geralmente usado em maior escala por empresas privadas, que oferecem os famosos serviços de alojamento de sites. São essencialmente um grande número de máquinas que fornecem o serviço que descrevemos, mas desta vez não apenas para um site com alguns vídeos, mas para milhares de sites de todo o mundo.\nExistem empresas muito maiores que oferecem mais potência e serviços. Hoje em dia, até se montam servidores exclusivamente para atender às demandas de serviços de inteligência artificial.\nO Fediverso Agora que temos uma ideia geral de como um servidor funciona, vamos falar sobre o Fediverso. O Fediverso é um ecossistema de aplicações que, por sua vez, têm canais, chamados instâncias. A atividade de cada instância é alojada num servidor que é administrado por uma comunidade, uma pessoa ou uma empresa privada. Pode-se dizer que é semelhante ao Discord, onde se aluga um servidor para a sua comunidade. Mas há uma diferença: todos esses servidores pertencem à empresa Discord, enquanto no Fediverso tudo é independente.\nNo Fediverso, existem aplicações como o Mastodon, que é semelhante ao X (antigo Twitter), com canais ou instâncias independentes, cada um com os seus próprios servidores e administradores. Ao contrário do Twitter, onde tudo acaba nos servidores de Elon Musk, no Mastodon os dados podem permanecer no servidor dessa instância específica ou ser partilhados com outras instâncias noutros servidores. Isto depende de os administradores terem decidido formar uma comunidade de canais onde os dados são partilhados. Esta atividade chama-se federação.\nA capacidade de federar existe graças a um protocolo de dados inovador chamado ActivityPub. Para dar um exemplo prático: imagine que o YouTube e o TikTok eram federados. Você “gosta” de um vídeo no YouTube, e esse utilizador receberia a notificação no TikTok. Poderia seguir alguém do TikTok a partir da sua conta do YouTube. Nas plataformas atuais, isso não acontece porque são sistemas fechados. O YouTube e o TikTok não podem federar porque não usam o ActivityPub.\nE isto não é ficção científica: no Fediverso, ISTO JÁ funciona. Pode seguir um criador de vídeos no PeerTube a partir da sua conta Mastodon, ou comentar um podcast no Castopod sem sair da sua aplicação. É como viver num bairro onde todas as casas têm portas que se abrem umas para as outras, em vez de estarem todos trancados nos seus bunkers.\nDentro do Fediverso, não existe apenas o Mastodon. Existem também aplicações dedicadas a vídeos, podcasts, etc., e todas elas podem federar entre si porque usam o protocolo ActivityPub. Existe o PeerTube para vídeos e o Castopod para podcasts.\nO Futuro do Fediverso O Fediverso foi construído para combater os monopólios de grandes empresas como a Google, a Microsoft e a Apple. No entanto, existem muitos desafios pela frente, e eu identifiquei alguns problemas.\nPor um lado, embora tudo pareça aberto e descentralizado, muitas instâncias permanecem fechadas. Existem comunidades fechadas que não se abrem à comunidade em geral. Este elitismo digital manifesta-se nos chamados “gatekeepers”: administradores que decidem unilateralmente quais instâncias merecem federar com a sua, quem pode entrar na sua comunidade ou que conteúdos são “dignos”.\nExistem instâncias que exigem “cartas de apresentação”, como se fossem clubes exclusivos. Outras bloqueiam instâncias inteiras por pequenas diferenças ideológicas, fragmentando ainda mais o ecossistema. Ironicamente, o Fediverso promete libertar-nos dos algoritmos de Zuckerberg e Musk, mas agora temos centenas de pequenos Zuckerbergs com os seus próprios reinos digitais.\nPor outro lado, notei no Mastodon uma síndrome que também pode ser detetada numa aplicação fechada como o Substack. No Substack, reparei que toda a gente escreve, mas ninguém lê os outros. E se leem, não comentam. Fica-se com a sensação de que as pessoas leem o que escrevemos, mas seguem em frente. Sinto algo semelhante no Mastodon.\nProvavelmente é porque recebemos tanta informação, em tanta quantidade, e acredite, toda informação é valiosa. Recebemos tanta informação que não paramos para agradecer pelo que vemos, pelo que lemos, por aquela mensagem que nos é enviada do outro lado. E se isso ajuda em alguma coisa, a dar valor a tudo o que nos chega, vamos aprender a ler nas entrelinhas, a entender o que aquele texto ou bilhete realmente nos diz, mesmo que pareça banal ou trivial.\nVamos inverter o contexto. Passamos muito tempo offline e longe de tudo. Vamos imaginar que estamos em um mundo completamente estranho à nossa sociedade, vamos imaginar que estamos no planeta Marte. E acontece que recebemos uma mensagem, ou um Toot, como os chamam no Mastodon. Imagine o quão valioso esse Toot será para nós. Seja um vídeo, um áudio ou uma frase simples, ele faz você sentir que não está sozinho e que há alguém do outro lado. Nós o consideraríamos muito mais valioso, justamente porque aquele Toot chegou em um momento de solidão e necessidade e, portanto, precisávamos dele. Por isso, é importante nos posicionarmos sob essa perspectiva para valorizar tudo o que chega, mesmo que a intenção do outro lado seja diferente.\nFinalmente, surge uma pergunta incômoda: se o Fediverse reproduz a mesma dinâmica de poder que critica, não seria simplesmente feudalismo digital com melhor marketing? Ou ainda há esperança de que a descentralização cumpra sua promessa original?\nEnsaio de RGartner\nहिन्दी (Hindi) फेडिवर्स, मैस्टोडॉन और विकेंद्रीकृत एप्लिकेशन क्या हैं? सर्वर (Servers) फेडिवर्स को समझने के लिए, हमें पहले यह समझना होगा कि सर्वर क्या है। आपका सर्वर एक राउटर की तरह होता है; इसमें काम करने के लिए इनपुट और आउटपुट होते हैं। यदि आप अपने कंप्यूटर को एक निश्चित तरीके से कॉन्फ़िगर करते हैं तो वह एक सर्वर हो सकता है। कल्पना कीजिए कि आपके पास साझा करने के लिए वीडियो हैं और आप इसे अपने घर से करना चाहते हैं। यदि आपका कंप्यूटर अब एक सर्वर है, तो आप उन वीडियो को अपने घर से साझा कर सकते हैं। आपको वर्डप्रेस जैसे सॉफ़्टवेयर का उपयोग करके किसी अन्य कंप्यूटर के साथ एक वेबसाइट बनानी होगी और उसे अपने कंप्यूटर-सर्वर से जोड़ना होगा। इस प्रणाली के साथ, आम जनता उस वेबसाइट पर जाएगी, आपके वीडियो के थंबनेल देखेगी, क्लिक करेगी, और वहां से सिग्नल आपके कंप्यूटर-सर्वर को भेजा जाएगा। यह उस अनुरोध को एक इनपुट के रूप में प्राप्त करता है और, एक आउटपुट के रूप में, आपके वीडियो के सिग्नल को वेब पर भेजता है ताकि जनता उसे देख सके। बैंडविड्थ के आधार पर, 5G जैसी तकनीकी प्रगति के कारण इसमें मिलीसेकंड लग सकते हैं। मोटे तौर पर, यह एक सर्वर है: यह वीडियो, ऑडियो और सभी प्रकार के डेटा जैसी सामग्री के लिए इनपुट और आउटपुट की सेवा प्रदान करता है।\nयह एक व्यक्तिगत सर्वर का एक उदाहरण है, जिसे तार्किक रूप से किसी भी समय अनुरोधों का जवाब देने के लिए 24/7 चालू रहने की आवश्यकता होगी। यह प्रणाली आम तौर पर निजी कंपनियों द्वारा बड़े पैमाने पर उपयोग की जाती है, जो प्रसिद्ध वेब होस्टिंग सेवाएं प्रदान करती हैं। ये अनिवार्य रूप से बड़ी संख्या में मशीनें हैं जो हमारे द्वारा वर्णित सेवा प्रदान कर रही हैं, लेकिन इस बार केवल कुछ वीडियो वाली एक वेबसाइट के लिए नहीं, बल्कि दुनिया भर की हजारों वेबसाइटों के लिए। ऐसी बहुत बड़ी कंपनियाँ हैं जो अधिक शक्ति और सेवाएँ प्रदान करती हैं। आज, सर्वर केवल कृत्रिम बुद्धिमत्ता सेवाओं की मांगों को संभालने के लिए भी स्थापित किए जाते हैं।\nफेडिवर्स (The Fediverse) अब जब हमें एक सामान्य विचार है कि एक सर्वर कैसे काम करता है, तो चलिए फेडिवर्स के बारे में बात करते हैं। फेडिवर्स अनुप्रयोगों का एक पारिस्थितिकी तंत्र है, जिसमें बदले में चैनल होते हैं, जिन्हें इंस्टेंस (instances) कहा जाता है। प्रत्येक इंस्टेंस की गतिविधि एक सर्वर पर होस्ट की जाती है जिसे एक समुदाय, एक व्यक्ति या एक निजी कंपनी द्वारा प्रशासित किया जाता है। आप कह सकते हैं कि यह डिस्कॉर्ड के समान है, जहाँ आप अपने समुदाय की मेजबानी के लिए एक सर्वर किराए पर लेते हैं। लेकिन एक अंतर है: वे सभी सर्वर डिस्कॉर्ड कंपनी के हैं, जबकि फेडिवर्स में, सब कुछ स्वतंत्र है। फेडिवर्स में, आपके पास मैस्टोडॉन जैसे एप्लिकेशन हैं, जो एक्स (पूर्व में ट्विटर) के समान है, जिसमें स्वतंत्र चैनल या इंस्टेंस होते हैं, प्रत्येक के अपने सर्वर और प्रशासक होते हैं। ट्विटर के विपरीत, जहां सब कुछ एलोन मस्क के सर्वर पर समाप्त होता है, मैस्टोडॉन में डेटा उस विशिष्ट इंस्टेंस के सर्वर पर रह सकता है या अन्य सर्वर पर अन्य इंस्टेंस के साथ साझा किया जा सकता है। यह इस बात पर निर्भर करता है कि क्या प्रशासकों ने चैनलों का एक समुदाय बनाने का फैसला किया है जहां डेटा साझा किया जाता है। इस गतिविधि को संघ (federation) कहा जाता है।\nसंघ की क्षमता ActivityPub नामक एक अभिनव डेटा प्रोटोकॉल के कारण मौजूद है। आपको एक व्यावहारिक उदाहरण देने के लिए: कल्पना कीजिए कि यूट्यूब और टिकटॉक संघबद्ध थे। आप यूट्यूब पर एक वीडियो को “लाइक” करते हैं, और उस उपयोगकर्ता को टिकटॉक के भीतर अधिसूचना प्राप्त होगी। आप अपने यूट्यूब खाते से टिकटॉक पर किसी का अनुसरण कर सकते हैं। आज के प्लेटफार्मों में, ऐसा नहीं होता है क्योंकि वे बंद सिस्टम हैं। यूट्यूब और टिकटॉक संघबद्ध नहीं हो सकते क्योंकि वे एक्टिविटीपब का उपयोग नहीं करते हैं।\nऔर यह विज्ञान कथा नहीं है: फेडिवर्स में, यह पहले से ही काम करता है। आप अपने मैस्टोडॉन खाते से पीयरट्यूब पर एक वीडियो निर्माता का अनुसरण कर सकते हैं, या अपने पसंदीदा ऐप को छोड़े बिना कास्टोपॉड पर एक पॉडकास्ट पर टिप्पणी कर सकते हैं। यह एक ऐसे पड़ोस में रहने जैसा है जहाँ सभी घरों के दरवाजे एक-दूसरे के लिए खुले हैं, बजाय इसके कि हर कोई अपने बंकर में बंद हो।\nफेडिवर्स के भीतर, केवल मैस्टोडॉन ही नहीं है। वीडियो, पॉडकास्ट आदि के लिए समर्पित एप्लिकेशन भी हैं, और वे सभी एक-दूसरे के साथ संघबद्ध हो सकते हैं क्योंकि वे एक्टिविटीपब प्रोटोकॉल का उपयोग करते हैं। वीडियो के लिए पीयरट्यूब और पॉडकास्ट के लिए कास्टोपॉड है।\nफेडिवर्स का भविष्य (The Future of the Fediverse) फेडिवर्स का निर्माण गूगल, माइक्रोसॉफ्ट और एप्पल जैसी बड़ी कंपनियों के एकाधिकार से निपटने के लिए किया गया था। हालाँकि, आगे कई चुनौतियाँ हैं, और मैंने कुछ समस्याओं की पहचान की है।\nएक ओर, जबकि सब कुछ खुला और विकेंद्रीकृत लगता है, कई इंस्टेंस बंद रहते हैं। ऐसे बंद समुदाय हैं जो आम समुदाय के लिए नहीं खुलते हैं। यह डिजिटल अभिजात्यवाद तथाकथित “द्वारपालकों” (gatekeepers) में प्रकट होता है: प्रशासक जो एकतरफा निर्णय लेते हैं कि कौन से इंस्टेंस उनके साथ संघबद्ध होने के योग्य हैं, कौन उनके समुदाय में शामिल हो सकता है, या कौन सी सामग्री “योग्य” है।\nऐसे इंस्टेंस हैं जिनमें शामिल होने के लिए “परिचय पत्र” की आवश्यकता होती है, जैसे कि वे विशेष क्लब हों। अन्य मामूली वैचारिक मतभेदों पर पूरे इंस्टेंस को ब्लॉक कर देते हैं, जिससे पारिस्थितिकी तंत्र और भी खंडित हो जाता है। विडंबना यह है कि फेडिवर्स हमें ज़करबर्ग और मस्क के एल्गोरिदम से मुक्त करने का वादा करता है, लेकिन अब हमारे पास अपने स्वयं के डिजिटल राज्यों के साथ सैकड़ों छोटे ज़करबर्ग हैं।\nदूसरी ओर, मैंने मैस्टोडॉन में एक सिंड्रोम देखा है जो सबस्टैक जैसे बंद एप्लिकेशन में भी देखा जा सकता है। सबस्टैक पर, मैंने पाया कि हर कोई लिखता है, लेकिन कोई भी दूसरों को नहीं पढ़ता है। और अगर वे पढ़ते हैं, तो वे टिप्पणी नहीं करते हैं। आपको यह महसूस होता है कि लोग आपको पढ़ते हैं लेकिन आगे बढ़ जाते हैं। मुझे मैस्टोडॉन में कुछ ऐसा ही महसूस होता है।\nऐसा शायद इसलिए है क्योंकि हमें इतनी सारी जानकारी, इतनी मात्रा में मिलती है, और यकीन मानिए, सारी जानकारी मूल्यवान होती है। हमें इतनी सारी जानकारी मिलती है कि हम जो देखते हैं, जो पढ़ते हैं, उस संदेश के लिए जो दूसरी तरफ से हमें भेजा जाता है, उसके लिए कृतज्ञता व्यक्त करना नहीं छोड़ते। और अगर यह हमारे सामने आने वाली हर चीज़ को महत्व देने में ज़रा भी मदद करता है, तो आइए पंक्तियों के बीच पढ़ना सीखें, यह समझें कि वह पाठ या नोट असल में हमें क्या बता रहा है, भले ही वह साधारण या मामूली लगे।\nआइए संदर्भ को उलट दें। हम बहुत सारा समय ऑफ़लाइन और हर चीज़ से दूर बिताते हैं। मान लीजिए कि हम एक ऐसी दुनिया में हैं जो हमारे समाज से बिल्कुल अलग है, मान लीजिए कि हम मंगल ग्रह पर हैं। और पता चलता है कि हमें एक संदेश, या एक टूट, जैसा कि मैस्टोडॉन पर कहा जाता है, प्राप्त होता है। सोचिए कि वह टूट हमारे लिए कितना मूल्यवान होगा। चाहे वह वीडियो हो, ऑडियो हो, या कोई साधारण वाक्यांश हो, यह आपको ऐसा एहसास दिलाता है कि आप अकेले नहीं हैं और दूसरी तरफ कोई है। हम इसे कहीं ज़्यादा मूल्यवान मानेंगे, क्योंकि वह टूट अकेलेपन और ज़रूरत के समय आया था, और इसलिए, हमें इसकी ज़रूरत थी। इसलिए ज़रूरी है कि हम इस नज़रिए से खुद को स्थापित करें और आने वाली हर चीज़ का मूल्यांकन करें, भले ही दूसरी तरफ़ का इरादा अलग हो।\nअंत में, एक असहज सवाल उठता है: अगर फेडिवर्स उसी शक्ति-गतिकी को दोहराता है जिसकी वह आलोचना करता है, तो क्या यह सिर्फ़ बेहतर मार्केटिंग वाला डिजिटल सामंतवाद नहीं है? या क्या विकेंद्रीकरण के अपने मूल वादे को पूरा करने की अभी भी उम्मीद है?\nआर.जी.गार्टनर निबंध\n",

<h3 id="servers">Servers<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#servers">#</a></h3>
<p>To understand the Fediverse, we first need to understand what a server is. Your server is much like a router; it has inputs and outputs to perform tasks. Your computer could be a server if you configure it a certain way. Imagine you have videos to share and want to do it from your home. If your computer is now a server, you could share those videos from your house. You would need to create a website with another computer using software like WordPress and connect it to your computer-server. With this system, the general public would visit that website, see thumbnails of your videos, click on one, and a signal would be sent to your computer-server. It receives this request as an input and, as an output, sends the video signal to the web for the public to see. Depending on bandwidth, this can take milliseconds, thanks to technological advances like 5G. Broadly speaking, this is a server: as its name implies, it provides a service of input and output for content like videos, audio, and all types of data.</p>
<p>This is an example of a personal server, which logically would need to be on 24/7 to respond to requests at any time. This system is generally used on a larger scale by private companies, which offer the famous web hosting services. These are essentially a large number of machines providing the service we described, but this time serving not just one website with a few videos, but thousands and thousands of websites from all over the world that want to use their server hosting.</p>
<p>There are much larger companies that offer more power and services, such as national telephone companies or international giants. Today, servers are even set up solely to handle the demands of artificial intelligence services.</p>
<h3 id="the-fediverse">The Fediverse<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#the-fediverse">#</a></h3>
<p>Now that we have a general idea of how a server works, let&rsquo;s talk about the Fediverse.</p>
<p>The Fediverse is an ecosystem of applications that, in turn, have channels called instances. The activity of each channel, or instance, is hosted on a server administered by a community, an individual, or a private company. So far, you could say this is similar to Discord, where you rent a server to host your community. But there&rsquo;s a difference: all those servers belong to the company Discord, whereas in the Fediverse, everything is independent.</p>
<p>In the Fediverse, you have applications like Mastodon, which is similar to X (formerly Twitter), with independent channels or instances, each with its own servers and administrators. Unlike Twitter, where everything that happens ends up on Elon Musk&rsquo;s servers (who, let&rsquo;s remember, owns the company), Mastodon has so many channels and instances that the data can remain on the server of that specific channel or instance, or it can be cross-posted to other channels or instances on other servers. This depends on whether the administrators of these servers have decided to form a community of channels and servers where data is shared. This activity is called federation.</p>
<p>The ability to federate exists thanks to a special and innovative data protocol called ActivityPub, which allows for this data exchange. To give you a practical example: Imagine if YouTube and TikTok were federated. You &ldquo;like&rdquo; a video on YouTube, and that user would receive the notification within TikTok. You could follow someone from TikTok on your YouTube account. In today&rsquo;s platforms, this doesn&rsquo;t happen because they are closed systems by corporate decision. YouTube and TikTok cannot federate because they do not use ActivityPub.</p>
<p>And this isn&rsquo;t science fiction: in the Fediverse, this ALREADY works. You can follow a video creator on PeerTube from your Mastodon account, or comment on a Castopod podcast without leaving your favorite app. It&rsquo;s like living in a neighborhood where all the houses have doors that open to each other, instead of everyone being locked in their own bunker. When you receive a notification on your mobile or PC, it&rsquo;s because you have granted permissions on your device. This means that by approving notifications, you have initiated a form of federation between your device and the application you gave permissions to.</p>
<p>Within the Fediverse, it’s not just Mastodon with its ability to write posts, upload short audio clips, or share links like on Twitter. The Fediverse also has dedicated applications for videos, podcasts, etc., and they all share the unique feature of being able to federate with each other because they use the ActivityPub protocol. There&rsquo;s PeerTube for videos and Castopod for uploading podcasts.</p>
<h3 id="the-future-of-the-fediverse">The Future of the Fediverse<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#the-future-of-the-fediverse">#</a></h3>
<p>The Fediverse was supposedly built to combat the monopolies of large companies like Google, Microsoft, and Apple, which use our data for many things. However, there are many challenges ahead, and I have identified a couple of problems.</p>
<p>On one hand, while everything seems open and decentralized, many channels or instances remain closed. There are closed communities that, for their own reasons, do not open up to the general community. This digital elitism is manifested in the so-called &ldquo;gatekeepers&rdquo;: administrators who unilaterally decide which instances are worthy of federating with theirs, who can join their community, or what content is &ldquo;worthy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There are instances that require &ldquo;letters of introduction&rdquo; to join, as if they were exclusive clubs. Others block entire instances over minor ideological differences, further fragmenting the ecosystem. Ironically, the Fediverse promises to free us from the algorithms of Zuckerberg and Musk, but now we have hundreds of little Zuckerbergs with their own digital kingdoms. In a way, this doesn&rsquo;t align with the spirit of an open community.</p>
<p>On the other hand, while applications like Mastodon are quite friendly to newcomers, I&rsquo;ve noticed a syndrome in Mastodon that can also be seen in a closed application like Substack. For those who don&rsquo;t know it, Substack is a closed app, but it&rsquo;s a place where many who enjoy writing leave their work for the public to read. What I detected in Substack is that everyone writes, but nobody reads anyone else. And if they read, they don&rsquo;t comment, and if they don&rsquo;t comment, we don&rsquo;t know if they read it, if they read a little, or a lot, or perhaps they read but didn&rsquo;t understand what the messenger wanted to say. In Substack, you get the feeling that people read you but move on. I feel something similar in Mastodon, and I hope it&rsquo;s not as severe.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s probably because we receive so much information, in such quantity, and believe me, all information is valuable. We receive so much information that we don&rsquo;t stop to be grateful for what we see, what we read, for that message sent to us from the other side. And if it helps at all, to give value to everything that comes our way, let&rsquo;s learn to read between the lines, to understand what that text or note is really telling us, even if it seems banal or trivial.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s reverse the context. We spend a lot of time offline and away from everything. Let&rsquo;s imagine we&rsquo;re in a world completely alien to our society, let&rsquo;s imagine we&rsquo;re on the planet Mars. And it turns out we receive a message, or a Toot, as they call them on Mastodon. Imagine how valuable that Toot will be to us. Whether it&rsquo;s a video, an audio, or a simple phrase, it makes you feel like you&rsquo;re not alone and that there&rsquo;s someone on the other side. We would consider it much more valuable, precisely because that Toot arrived at a time of loneliness and need, and therefore, we needed it. That&rsquo;s why it&rsquo;s important to position ourselves from this perspective to value everything that arrives, even if the intention on the other side is different.</p>
<p>Finally, an uncomfortable question arises: If the Fediverse reproduces the same power dynamics it criticizes, isn&rsquo;t it simply digital feudalism with better marketing? Or is there still hope for decentralization to fulfill its original promise?</p>

<h3 id="server">Server<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#server">#</a></h3>
<p>Um das Fediverse zu verstehen, müssen wir zuerst verstehen, was ein Server ist. Ihr Server ist so etwas wie ein Router; er hat Ein- und Ausgänge, um Aufgaben auszuführen. Ihr Computer könnte ein Server sein, wenn Sie ihn entsprechend konfigurieren. Stellen Sie sich vor, Sie haben Videos, die Sie von zu Hause aus teilen möchten. Wenn Ihr Computer nun ein Server ist, könnten Sie diese Videos von dort aus teilen. Sie müssten eine Website mit einem anderen Computer über eine Software wie WordPress erstellen und sie mit Ihrem Computer-Server verbinden. Mit diesem System würde die Öffentlichkeit diese Website besuchen, Miniaturansichten Ihrer Videos sehen, klicken, und von dort würde das Signal an Ihren Computer-Server gesendet. Dieser empfängt die Anfrage als Eingang und sendet als Ausgang das Videosignal an das Web, damit die Öffentlichkeit es sehen kann. Dies kann dank technologischer Fortschritte wie 5G Millisekunden dauern. Im Großen und Ganzen ist das ein Server: Er bietet einen Dienst für die Ein- und Ausgabe von Inhalten wie Videos, Audiodaten und allen Arten von Daten.</p>
<p>Dies ist ein Beispiel für einen persönlichen Server, der logischerweise 24 Stunden am Tag eingeschaltet sein müsste, um jederzeit auf Anfragen reagieren zu können. Dieses System wird in der Regel in größerem Maßstab von privaten Unternehmen genutzt, die das berühmte Webhosting anbieten. Dabei handelt es sich im Grunde um eine große Anzahl von Maschinen, die den zuvor beschriebenen Dienst bereitstellen, diesmal jedoch nicht nur für eine Website mit einigen Videos, sondern für Tausende von Websites aus aller Welt.
Es gibt weitaus größere Unternehmen, die mehr Leistung und Dienstleistungen anbieten, wie nationale Telefongesellschaften oder internationale Riesen. Heutzutage werden Server sogar ausschließlich zur Deckung der Nachfrage nach Diensten der künstlichen Intelligenz eingerichtet.</p>
<h3 id="das-fediverse">Das Fediverse<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#das-fediverse">#</a></h3>
<p>Nachdem wir nun eine allgemeine Vorstellung davon haben, wie ein Server funktioniert, sprechen wir über das Fediverse.
Das Fediverse ist ein Ökosystem von Anwendungen, die wiederum Kanäle haben, die als Instanzen bezeichnet werden. Die Aktivität jedes Kanals oder jeder Instanz wird auf einem Server gehostet, der von einer Gemeinschaft, einer Einzelperson oder einem privaten Unternehmen verwaltet wird. Man könnte sagen, das ist ähnlich wie bei Discord, wo man einen Server mietet, um seine Community zu beherbergen. Der Unterschied besteht jedoch darin, dass all diese Server dem Unternehmen Discord gehören, während im Fediverse alles unabhängig ist.</p>
<p>Im Fediverse gibt es Anwendungen wie Mastodon, das X (ehemals Twitter) ähnelt, mit unabhängigen Kanälen oder Instanzen, die jeweils über eigene Server und Administratoren verfügen. Im Gegensatz zu Twitter, wo alles auf den Servern von Elon Musk landet, gibt es bei Mastodon so viele Kanäle und Instanzen, dass die Daten auf dem Server des jeweiligen Kanals verbleiben oder auch auf andere Kanäle mit anderen Servern übertragen werden können. Dies hängt davon ab, ob die Administratoren dieser Server beschlossen haben, eine Gemeinschaft von Kanälen und Servern zu bilden, in der Daten geteilt werden. Diese Aktivität wird Föderation genannt.</p>
<p>Die Möglichkeit zur Föderation besteht dank eines innovativen Datenprotokolls namens ActivityPub. Ein praktisches Beispiel: Stellen Sie sich vor, YouTube und TikTok wären föderiert. Sie geben einem Video auf YouTube ein &ldquo;Gefällt mir&rdquo;, und der Nutzer würde die Benachrichtigung in TikTok erhalten. Sie könnten jemandem von TikTok über Ihr YouTube-Konto folgen. Auf den heutigen Plattformen geschieht dies nicht, da es sich um geschlossene Systeme handelt. YouTube und TikTok können nicht föderieren, weil sie ActivityPub nicht verwenden.</p>
<p>Und das ist keine Science-Fiction: Im Fediverse funktioniert das BEREITS so. Sie können einem Videoersteller auf PeerTube von Ihrem Mastodon-Konto aus folgen oder einen Podcast auf Castopod kommentieren, ohne Ihre Lieblings-App zu verlassen. Es ist, als ob man in einer Nachbarschaft lebt, in der alle Häuser offene Türen haben, anstatt dass jeder in seinem Bunker eingesperrt ist.</p>
<p>Im Fediverse gibt es nicht nur Mastodon mit seinen Möglichkeiten, Beiträge zu schreiben oder Links zu teilen. Es gibt auch spezielle Anwendungen für Videos, Podcasts usw., die alle die Besonderheit haben, sich untereinander föderieren zu können, weil sie das ActivityPub-Protokoll verwenden. Es gibt PeerTube für Videos und Castopod für Podcasts.</p>
<h3 id="die-zukunft-des-fediverse">Die Zukunft des Fediverse<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#die-zukunft-des-fediverse">#</a></h3>
<p>Das Fediverse wurde angeblich gebaut, um die Monopole großer Unternehmen wie Google, Microsoft und Apple zu bekämpfen. Es gibt jedoch viele Herausforderungen, und ich habe einige Probleme festgestellt.</p>
<p>Einerseits bleiben viele Kanäle oder Instanzen geschlossen, obwohl alles offen und dezentral erscheint. Es gibt geschlossene Gemeinschaften, die sich aus eigenen Gründen nicht der allgemeinen Gemeinschaft öffnen. Dieser digitale Elitismus zeigt sich in den sogenannten &ldquo;Gatekeepern&rdquo;: Administratoren, die einseitig entscheiden, welche Instanzen es wert sind, sich mit ihrer zu föderieren, wer ihrer Gemeinschaft beitreten darf oder welche Inhalte &ldquo;würdig&rdquo; sind.</p>
<p>Es gibt Instanzen, die &ldquo;Vorstellungsbriefe&rdquo; verlangen, als wären sie exklusive Clubs. Andere blockieren ganze Instanzen wegen geringfügiger ideologischer Differenzen, was das Ökosystem weiter fragmentiert. Ironischerweise verspricht das Fediverse, uns von den Algorithmen von Zuckerberg und Musk zu befreien, aber jetzt haben wir Hunderte kleiner Zuckerbergs mit ihren eigenen digitalen Königreichen.</p>
<p>Andererseits habe ich bei Mastodon ein Syndrom beobachtet, das auch in einer geschlossenen Anwendung wie Substack zu finden ist. Bei Substack habe ich festgestellt, dass jeder schreibt, aber niemand liest. Und wenn sie lesen, kommentieren sie nicht. Man hat das Gefühl, dass die Leute einen lesen, aber einfach weiterziehen. Ähnliches empfinde ich bei Mastodon.</p>
<p>Das liegt wahrscheinlich daran, dass wir so viele Informationen in so großer Menge erhalten, und glauben Sie mir, jede Information ist wertvoll. Wir erhalten so viele Informationen, dass wir nicht innehalten, um dankbar zu sein für das, was wir sehen, was wir lesen, für die Nachricht, die uns von der anderen Seite geschickt wird. Und wenn es überhaupt hilft, allem, was uns begegnet, einen Wert beizumessen, dann lasst uns lernen, zwischen den Zeilen zu lesen, zu verstehen, was uns dieser Text oder diese Nachricht wirklich sagen will, selbst wenn sie banal oder trivial erscheint.</p>
<p>Drehen wir den Kontext um. Wir verbringen viel Zeit offline und fernab von allem. Stellen wir uns vor, wir befinden uns in einer unserer Gesellschaft völlig fremden Welt, stellen wir uns vor, wir sind auf dem Planeten Mars. Und es stellt sich heraus, dass wir eine Nachricht erhalten, oder einen Toot, wie sie auf Mastodon genannt werden. Stellen Sie sich vor, wie wertvoll dieser Toot für uns sein wird. Ob Video, Audio oder ein einfacher Satz – er gibt Ihnen das Gefühl, nicht allein zu sein und dass da jemand auf der anderen Seite ist. Wir würden es als viel wertvoller erachten, gerade weil Toot in einer Zeit der Einsamkeit und Not ankam und wir es deshalb brauchten. Deshalb ist es wichtig, uns aus dieser Perspektive zu positionieren, um alles wertzuschätzen, was ankommt, auch wenn die Absicht auf der anderen Seite eine andere ist.</p>
<p>Schließlich stellt sich eine unangenehme Frage: Wenn das Fediverse dieselben Machtdynamiken reproduziert, die es kritisiert, handelt es sich dann nicht einfach um digitalen Feudalismus mit besserer Vermarktung? Oder besteht noch Hoffnung, dass die Dezentralisierung ihr ursprüngliches Versprechen einlöst?</p>

<p>Para entender el Fediverso tenemos que entender qué es un servidor. Tu servidor es lo más parecido a un router, que contiene entradas y salidas para hacer cosas. Tu computadora podría ser un servidor si la configuras de cierta manera. Imaginemos que tienes unos videos para compartir y quieres hacerlo desde tu casa. Si tu computadora ahora es un servidor podrías compartir desde tu casa esos videos. Tendrías que crear una web con otra computadora a través de software como WordPress u otros y conectar a tu computadora-servidor. Con este sistema, el público general irá a esa web donde habrá unas miniaturas de tus videos, daría clic, y de ahí se envía la señal a tu computadora-servidor que recibe esa petición en su entrada, y en su salida envía la señal de tu video a la web para que el público lo vea. Esto, dependiendo del ancho de banda de la velocidad de las conexiones puede durar milisegundos gracias a los avances tecnológicos como el 5g. A grandes rasgos esto es un servidor, que como su nombre lo indica, da un servicio de entrada y salida de contenidos, como videos, audios y todo tipo de datos.</p>
<p>Este ejemplo es de un servidor personal, que por lógica tendría que estar encendido las 24 horas para responder las peticiones en cualquier momento. Este sistema generalmente se usa en una mayor escala, con empresas privadas, que son precisamente las que ofrecen los famosos hostings o alojamiento de webs, que en realidad son una cantidad de máquinas que están dando el servicio que describimos anteriormente, pero esta vez dando servicio no solo a una web con unos videos, sino que dan servicio a miles y miles de webs de todo el mundo que quieran utilizar los alojamientos en esos servidores.</p>
<p>Hay empresas mucho más grandes que ofrecen más potencia y más servicios como las telefónicas nacionales o empresas gigantes a nivel internacional. Hasta hoy en día se montan servidores únicamente para atender las demandas de servicios de inteligencia artificial.</p>
<h3 id="fediverso">Fediverso<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#fediverso">#</a></h3>
<p>Una vez que sabemos cómo funciona un servidor en líneas generales, hablemos del Fediverso.
El Fediverso es un ecosistema donde hay aplicaciones que a su vez tienen canales, que se llaman instancias. La actividad de cada canal o instancia, está alojada en un servidor que es administrado por una comunidad o una persona o empresa privada. Hasta aquí podría decirse que esta actividad es similar a Discord donde contratas un servidor para llevar a tu comunidad ahí. Pero hay una diferencia, y está en que todos esos servidores, pertenecen a la empresa Discord mientras que en el Fediverso es algo independiente.</p>
<p>En el Fediverso tienes aplicaciones como Mastodon que es un símil a X (Ex Twitter) donde hay canales o instancias con sus servidores y administradores independientes. A diferencia de Twitter, donde todo lo que sucede, va a parar a los servidores de Elon Musk, que recordemos, es el dueño de esa empresa, en Mastodon hay tantos canales e instancias que los datos pueden mantenerse en el servidor del canal o instancia, o también se pueden cruzar a otros canales o instancias que tienen otros servidores. Y esto dependerá si entre los administradores de estos servidores han decidido armar una comunidad de canales y servidores, donde se comparten datos, donde a esta actividad se le llama federarse.</p>
<p>La posibilidad de federarse existe gracias a un protocolo especial de datos innovador, llamado ActivityPub, que permite esta actividad de cruce de datos. Para darte un ejemplo y un caso práctico: Imagina que YouTube y TikTok estuvieran federadas. Le das &ldquo;me gusta&rdquo; a un video en YouTube y ese usuario recibiría la notificación dentro de TikTok. Podrías seguir a alguien de TikTok desde tu cuenta de YouTube. Esto, en las plataformas actuales, no sucede porque son sistemas cerrados por decisión empresarial. YouTube y TikTok no pueden federarse porque no usan ActivityPub.</p>
<p>Y esto no es ciencia ficción: en el Fediverso YA funciona así. Puedes seguir a un creador de videos en PeerTube desde tu cuenta de Mastodon, o comentar un podcast de Castopod sin salir de tu aplicación favorita. Es como si vivieras en un barrio donde todas las casas tienen puertas que se abren entre sí, en lugar de estar cada uno encerrado en su búnker. Cuando recibes una notificación en tu móvil o PC, es porque has otorgado permisos dentro de un dispositivo. Esto quiere decir que tú, al aprobar las notificaciones en tu dispositivo has iniciado una especie de federación entre tu dispositivo y la aplicación donde le has dado los permisos.</p>
<p>Dentro del Fediverso no solo está Mastodon con todas sus posibilidades, puedes escribir post, subir pequeños audios, o colocar enlaces como en Twitter. También en el Fediverso hay aplicaciones exclusivas para videos, podcast etc., y todas tienen la particularidad de poder federarse entre sí porque usan el protocolo ActivityPub que comentamos anteriormente. Está PeerTube para videos y Castopod para subir podcasts.</p>
<h3 id="futuro-del-fediverso">Futuro del Fediverso<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#futuro-del-fediverso">#</a></h3>
<p>El Fediverso dicen que fue construido para combatir precisamente los monopolios de las grandes empresas como Google, Microsoft, Apple, donde utilizan nuestros datos para muchas cosas. No obstante hay muchos desafíos por delante, ya que he detectado un par de problemas.</p>
<p>Por un lado, si bien todo parece abierto y descentralizado, muchos canales o instancias se mantienen cerradas. Hay comunidades cerradas que por sus particulares motivos no se abren a la comunidad en general. Este elitismo digital se manifiesta en los llamados &ldquo;gatekeepers&rdquo; o guardianes de acceso: administradores que deciden unilateralmente qué instancias merecen federarse con la suya, quién puede entrar a su comunidad, o qué contenidos son &ldquo;dignos&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Hay instancias que exigen &ldquo;cartas de presentación&rdquo; para unirte, como si fueran clubes exclusivos. Otras bloquean instancias completas por diferencias ideológicas menores, fragmentando aún más el ecosistema. Irónicamente, el Fediverso promete librarnos de los algoritmos de Zuckerberg y Musk, pero ahora tenemos cientos de pequeños Zuckerbergs con sus propios reinos digitales. Y en cierto modo, esto no va de la mano con el espíritu de comunidad abierta ciertamente.</p>
<p>Por el otro lado, si bien las aplicaciones como Mastodon ya son bastante amigables con los recién llegados, al menos en Mastodon he visto un síndrome que también puede detectarse en una aplicación cerrada como Substack. Para los que no la conocen, Substack es una aplicación de las cerradas, pero es un sitio donde muchos que gustan de escribir dejan sus trabajos y notas para que el público lea sus pensamientos. Y lo que detecté en Substack es que todo el mundo escribe, pero nadie lee al otro, y si lee, no comenta, y si no comenta, no sabemos si leyó, si leyó poco, o si leyó mucho, o quizás leyó pero no entendió lo que quería decir el mensajero. En Substack tienes la sensación de que te leen pero pasan de largo. Algo parecido siento en Mastodon, y espero que no sea tan grave.</p>
<p>Posiblemente se deba a que, recibimos tanta información, en tanta cantidad, y créanme, toda información es valiosa. Recibimos tanta información que no nos paramos a agradecer por eso que vemos, que leemos, por ese mensaje que nos mandan del otro lado. Y si de algo les sirve, para dar valor a todo lo que llegue, aprendamos a leer entre líneas, para comprender qué es lo que realmente nos dice ese texto o nota, aunque nos parezca banal o trivial.</p>
<p>Pongamos el contexto a la inversa. Nos encontramos durante mucho tiempo sin conexión y alejados de todo. Imaginemos que estamos en un mundo completamente ajeno a nuestra sociedad, imaginemos que estamos en el planeta Marte. Y resulta que recibimos un mensaje, o un Toot, así como los llaman en Mastodon. Imagina, qué valioso será ese Toot para nosotros. Ya sea un video, un audio, o una simple frase, que te haga sentir que no estás solo y que hay alguien al otro lado. Lo consideraríamos mucho más valioso, precisamente porque ese Toot, llegó en un momento de soledad y carencia, y por ende, lo necesitábamos. Por eso es importante posicionarnos desde esta perspectiva para dar valor a todo lo que llegue, por más que la intención que haya del otro lado, sea otra.</p>
<p>Por último me surge una pregunta incómoda: Si el Fediverso reproduce las mismas dinámicas de poder que critica, ¿no es simplemente feudalismo digital con mejor marketing? ¿O todavía hay esperanza de que la descentralización cumpla su promesa original?</p>

<p>Pour comprendre le Fediverse, il faut d&rsquo;abord comprendre ce qu&rsquo;est un serveur. Votre serveur ressemble beaucoup à un routeur ; il a des entrées et des sorties pour effectuer des tâches. Votre ordinateur pourrait être un serveur si vous le configurez d&rsquo;une certaine manière. Imaginons que vous ayez des vidéos à partager et que vous vouliez le faire depuis chez vous. Si votre ordinateur est maintenant un serveur, vous pourriez partager ces vidéos depuis votre maison. Vous devriez créer un site web avec un autre ordinateur via un logiciel comme WordPress et le connecter à votre ordinateur-serveur. Avec ce système, le public visiterait ce site, verrait des miniatures de vos vidéos, cliquerait, et de là, le signal serait envoyé à votre ordinateur-serveur. Celui-ci reçoit la requête en entrée et, en sortie, envoie le signal de votre vidéo au web pour que le public puisse la voir. Cela peut prendre des millisecondes grâce aux avancées technologiques comme la 5G. En bref, c&rsquo;est un serveur : il fournit un service d&rsquo;entrée et de sortie pour des contenus comme les vidéos, l&rsquo;audio et toutes sortes de données.</p>
<p>Ceci est un exemple de serveur personnel, qui devrait logiquement être allumé 24h/24. Ce système est généralement utilisé à plus grande échelle par des entreprises privées qui proposent les fameux services d&rsquo;hébergement web. Ce sont essentiellement un grand nombre de machines qui fournissent le service décrit précédemment, mais cette fois-ci non pas à un seul site, mais à des milliers de sites web du monde entier.</p>
<p>Il existe des entreprises beaucoup plus grandes qui offrent plus de puissance et de services. Aujourd&rsquo;hui, des serveurs sont même mis en place uniquement pour répondre aux demandes des services d&rsquo;intelligence artificielle.</p>
<h3 id="le-fediverse">Le Fediverse<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#le-fediverse">#</a></h3>
<p>Maintenant que nous savons comment fonctionne un serveur, parlons du Fediverse.
Le Fediverse est un écosystème d&rsquo;applications qui ont à leur tour des canaux, appelés instances. L&rsquo;activité de chaque instance est hébergée sur un serveur administré par une communauté, une personne ou une entreprise privée. On pourrait dire que c&rsquo;est similaire à Discord, où l&rsquo;on loue un serveur pour sa communauté. Mais il y a une différence : tous ces serveurs appartiennent à Discord, alors que dans le Fediverse, tout est indépendant.</p>
<p>Dans le Fediverse, vous avez des applications comme Mastodon, qui est similaire à X (anciennement Twitter), avec des canaux ou des instances indépendants, chacun avec ses propres serveurs et administrateurs. Contrairement à Twitter, où tout finit sur les serveurs d&rsquo;Elon Musk, sur Mastodon, les données peuvent rester sur le serveur de l&rsquo;instance ou être partagées avec d&rsquo;autres instances sur d&rsquo;autres serveurs. Cela dépend si les administrateurs ont décidé de former une communauté de canaux où les données sont partagées. Cette activité s&rsquo;appelle la fédération.</p>
<p>La possibilité de se fédérer existe grâce à un protocole de données innovant appelé ActivityPub. Pour vous donner un exemple pratique : imaginez que YouTube et TikTok soient fédérés. Vous &ldquo;aimez&rdquo; une vidéo sur YouTube, et cet utilisateur recevrait la notification dans TikTok. Vous pourriez suivre quelqu&rsquo;un de TikTok depuis votre compte YouTube. Sur les plateformes actuelles, cela n&rsquo;arrive pas car ce sont des systèmes fermés. YouTube et TikTok ne peuvent pas se fédérer car ils n&rsquo;utilisent pas ActivityPub.</p>
<p>Et ce n&rsquo;est pas de la science-fiction : dans le Fediverse, cela fonctionne DÉJÀ. Vous pouvez suivre un créateur de vidéos sur PeerTube depuis votre compte Mastodon, ou commenter un podcast sur Castopod sans quitter votre application. C&rsquo;est comme vivre dans un quartier où toutes les maisons ont des portes qui s&rsquo;ouvrent les unes aux autres, au lieu d&rsquo;être enfermé dans son bunker.</p>
<p>Dans le Fediverse, il n&rsquo;y a pas que Mastodon. Il existe également des applications dédiées pour les vidéos, les podcasts, etc., qui peuvent toutes se fédérer entre elles car elles utilisent le protocole ActivityPub. Il y a PeerTube pour les vidéos et Castopod pour les podcasts.</p>

<p>Le Fediverse a été conçu pour lutter contre les monopoles des grandes entreprises comme Google, Microsoft et Apple. Cependant, il y a de nombreux défis à relever, et j&rsquo;ai identifié quelques problèmes.</p>
<p>D&rsquo;une part, bien que tout semble ouvert et décentralisé, de nombreuses instances restent fermées. Il existe des communautés fermées qui ne s&rsquo;ouvrent pas à la communauté générale. Cet élitisme numérique se manifeste par les &ldquo;gardiens&rdquo; (gatekeepers) : des administrateurs qui décident unilatéralement quelles instances méritent de se fédérer avec la leur, qui peut rejoindre leur communauté ou quels contenus sont &ldquo;dignes&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Certaines instances exigent des &ldquo;lettres de motivation&rdquo;, comme s&rsquo;il s&rsquo;agissait de clubs exclusifs. D&rsquo;autres bloquent des instances entières pour des divergences idéologiques mineures, fragmentant davantage l&rsquo;écosystème. Ironiquement, le Fediverse promet de nous libérer des algorithmes de Zuckerberg et Musk, mais nous avons maintenant des centaines de petits Zuckerbergs avec leurs propres royaumes numériques.</p>
<p>D&rsquo;autre part, j&rsquo;ai remarqué sur Mastodon un syndrome que l&rsquo;on retrouve également sur une application fermée comme Substack. Sur Substack, j&rsquo;ai détecté que tout le monde écrit, mais personne ne lit les autres. Et s&rsquo;ils lisent, ils ne commentent pas. On a l&rsquo;impression que les gens vous lisent mais passent à autre chose. Je ressens quelque chose de similaire sur Mastodon.</p>
<p>C&rsquo;est probablement parce que nous recevons tellement d&rsquo;informations, en telle quantité, et croyez-moi, toute information est précieuse. Nous recevons tellement d&rsquo;informations que nous ne prenons pas le temps d&rsquo;être reconnaissants pour ce que nous voyons, ce que nous lisons, pour ce message qui nous est envoyé de l&rsquo;autre côté. Et si cela peut nous aider, pour valoriser tout ce qui nous arrive, apprenons à lire entre les lignes, à comprendre ce que ce texte ou ce message nous dit vraiment, même s&rsquo;il semble banal ou trivial.</p>
<p>Inversons le contexte. Nous passons beaucoup de temps hors ligne et loin de tout. Imaginons que nous soyons dans un monde complètement étranger à notre société, imaginons que nous soyons sur la planète Mars. Et il se trouve que nous recevons un message, ou un « tut », comme on les appelle sur Mastodon. Imaginez la valeur que ce « tut » aura pour nous. Qu&rsquo;il s&rsquo;agisse d&rsquo;une vidéo, d&rsquo;un audio ou d&rsquo;une simple phrase, il nous donne le sentiment de ne pas être seul et qu&rsquo;il y a quelqu&rsquo;un de l&rsquo;autre côté. Nous le considérerions comme bien plus précieux, précisément parce que ce Toot est arrivé à un moment de solitude et de besoin, et que, par conséquent, nous en avions besoin. C&rsquo;est pourquoi il est important de se positionner dans cette perspective pour valoriser tout ce qui arrive, même si l&rsquo;intention de l&rsquo;autre partie est différente.</p>
<p>Enfin, une question délicate se pose : si le Fediverse reproduit les mêmes dynamiques de pouvoir qu&rsquo;il critique, ne s&rsquo;agit-il pas simplement d&rsquo;un féodalisme numérique avec un marketing plus efficace ? Ou peut-on encore espérer que la décentralisation tienne ses promesses initiales ?</p>

<h3 id="server-1">Server<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#server-1">#</a></h3>
<p>Per capire il Fediverso, dobbiamo prima capire cos&rsquo;è un server. Un server è molto simile a un router; ha input e output per eseguire compiti. Il tuo computer potrebbe essere un server se lo configuri in un certo modo. Immagina di avere dei video da condividere da casa tua. Se il tuo computer è ora un server, potresti condividere quei video. Dovresti creare un sito web con un altro computer tramite un software come WordPress e collegarlo al tuo computer-server. Con questo sistema, il pubblico visiterebbe quel sito, vedrebbe le miniature dei tuoi video, farebbe clic, e da lì il segnale verrebbe inviato al tuo computer-server. Questo riceve la richiesta come input e, come output, invia il segnale del tuo video al web affinché il pubblico lo veda. Questo processo può durare millisecondi grazie a progressi tecnologici come il 5G. In linea generale, questo è un server: fornisce un servizio di input e output per contenuti come video, audio e dati di ogni tipo.</p>
<p>Questo è un esempio di un server personale, che logicamente dovrebbe rimanere acceso 24 ore su 24. Questo sistema è generalmente utilizzato su scala più ampia da aziende private che offrono i famosi servizi di hosting web. Si tratta essenzialmente di un gran numero di macchine che forniscono il servizio descritto, ma questa volta non solo per un sito con alcuni video, ma per migliaia di siti web in tutto il mondo.</p>
<p>Ci sono aziende molto più grandi che offrono più potenza e servizi. Oggi, i server vengono persino allestiti esclusivamente per soddisfare le esigenze dei servizi di intelligenza artificiale.</p>
<h3 id="il-fediverso">Il Fediverso<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#il-fediverso">#</a></h3>
<p>Ora che abbiamo un&rsquo;idea di come funziona un server, parliamo del Fediverso.</p>
<p>Il Fediverso è un ecosistema di applicazioni che a loro volta hanno canali, chiamati istanze. L&rsquo;attività di ogni istanza è ospitata su un server gestito da una comunità, una persona o un&rsquo;azienda privata. Si potrebbe dire che sia simile a Discord, dove si affitta un server per la propria comunità. Ma c&rsquo;è una differenza: tutti quei server appartengono a Discord, mentre nel Fediverso tutto è indipendente.
Nel Fediverso, ci sono applicazioni come Mastodon, che è simile a X (ex Twitter), con canali o istanze indipendenti, ognuna con i propri server e amministratori. A differenza di Twitter, dove tutto finisce sui server di Elon Musk, su Mastodon i dati possono rimanere sul server di quella specifica istanza o essere condivisi con altre istanze su altri server. Questo dipende dal fatto che gli amministratori abbiano deciso di formare una comunità di canali dove i dati vengono condivisi. Questa attività è chiamata federazione.</p>
<p>La possibilità di federarsi esiste grazie a un protocollo di dati innovativo chiamato ActivityPub. Per fare un esempio pratico: immagina se YouTube e TikTok fossero federati. Metti &ldquo;mi piace&rdquo; a un video su YouTube e quell&rsquo;utente riceverebbe la notifica su TikTok. Potresti seguire qualcuno di TikTok dal tuo account YouTube. Nelle piattaforme attuali, questo non accade perché sono sistemi chiusi. YouTube e TikTok non possono federarsi perché non usano ActivityPub.</p>
<p>E questa non è fantascienza: nel Fediverso FUNZIONA GIÀ così. Puoi seguire un creatore di video su PeerTube dal tuo account Mastodon, o commentare un podcast su Castopod senza lasciare la tua app preferita. È come vivere in un quartiere dove tutte le case hanno porte che si aprono l&rsquo;una all&rsquo;altra, invece di essere chiusi nel proprio bunker.</p>
<p>All&rsquo;interno del Fediverso non c&rsquo;è solo Mastodon. Ci sono anche applicazioni dedicate per video, podcast, ecc., che possono tutte federarsi tra loro perché usano il protocollo ActivityPub. C&rsquo;è PeerTube per i video e Castopod per i podcast.</p>
<h3 id="il-futuro-del-fediverso">Il Futuro del Fediverso<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#il-futuro-del-fediverso">#</a></h3>
<p>Il Fediverso è stato costruito per combattere i monopoli di grandi aziende come Google, Microsoft e Apple. Tuttavia, ci sono molte sfide da affrontare, e ho individuato un paio di problemi.</p>
<p>Da un lato, anche se tutto sembra aperto e decentralizzato, molte istanze rimangono chiuse. Ci sono comunità chiuse che non si aprono alla comunità generale. Questo elitismo digitale si manifesta nei cosiddetti &ldquo;gatekeeper&rdquo;: amministratori che decidono unilateralmente quali istanze meritano di federarsi con la loro, chi può entrare nella loro comunità o quali contenuti sono &ldquo;degni&rdquo;.
Ci sono istanze che richiedono &ldquo;lettere di presentazione&rdquo;, come se fossero club esclusivi. Altre bloccano intere istanze per piccole divergenze ideologiche, frammentando ulteriormente l&rsquo;ecosistema. Ironicamente, il Fediverso promette di liberarci dagli algoritmi di Zuckerberg e Musk, ma ora abbiamo centinaia di piccoli Zuckerberg con i loro regni digitali.</p>
<p>Dall&rsquo;altro lato, ho notato in Mastodon una sindrome che si può riscontrare anche in un&rsquo;applicazione chiusa come Substack. Su Substack, ho notato che tutti scrivono, ma nessuno legge gli altri. E se leggono, non commentano. Si ha la sensazione che le persone ti leggano ma passino oltre. Provo una sensazione simile su Mastodon.</p>
<p>Probabilmente è perché riceviamo così tante informazioni, in così grande quantità, e credetemi, tutte le informazioni sono preziose. Riceviamo così tante informazioni che non ci fermiamo ad essere grati per ciò che vediamo, per ciò che leggiamo, per quel messaggio che ci viene inviato dall&rsquo;aldilà. E se può essere d&rsquo;aiuto, per dare valore a tutto ciò che ci capita, impariamo a leggere tra le righe, a capire cosa ci sta realmente dicendo quel testo o quella nota, anche se sembra banale o banale.</p>
<p>Invertiamo il contesto. Passiamo molto tempo offline e lontani da tutto. Immaginiamo di essere in un mondo completamente estraneo alla nostra società, immaginiamo di essere sul pianeta Marte. E scopriamo di ricevere un messaggio, o un Toot, come lo chiamano su Mastodon. Immaginate quanto prezioso sarà per noi quel Toot. Che si tratti di un video, di un audio o di una semplice frase, vi fa sentire come se non foste soli e che ci sia qualcuno dall&rsquo;altra parte. Lo considereremmo molto più prezioso, proprio perché quel Toot è arrivato in un momento di solitudine e bisogno, e quindi ne avevamo bisogno. Ecco perché è importante posizionarci da questa prospettiva per dare valore a tutto ciò che arriva, anche se l&rsquo;intenzione dall&rsquo;altra parte è diversa.</p>
<p>Infine, sorge una domanda scomoda: se il Fediverso riproduce le stesse dinamiche di potere che critica, non si tratta semplicemente di feudalesimo digitale con un marketing migliore? O c&rsquo;è ancora speranza che la decentralizzazione mantenga la sua promessa originale?</p>

<p>Para entender o Fediverso, primeiro precisamos entender o que é um servidor. O seu servidor é muito parecido com um router; ele tem entradas e saídas para realizar tarefas. O seu computador poderia ser um servidor se o configurasse de uma certa maneira.</p>
<p>Imagine que você tem vídeos para partilhar e quer fazê-lo a partir de casa. Se o seu computador for agora um servidor, você poderia partilhar esses vídeos de sua casa. Teria de criar um site com outro computador através de um software como o WordPress e conectá-lo ao seu computador-servidor. Com este sistema, o público em geral iria a esse site, veria miniaturas dos seus vídeos, clicaria, e a partir daí o sinal seria enviado para o seu computador-servidor. Este recebe o pedido como entrada e, como saída, envia o sinal do seu vídeo para a web para que o público o veja. Dependendo da largura de banda, isto pode demorar milissegundos, graças a avanços tecnológicos como o 5G. Em termos gerais, isto é um servidor: ele fornece um serviço de entrada e saída para conteúdos como vídeos, áudios e todos os tipos de dados.</p>
<p>Este é um exemplo de um servidor pessoal, que logicamente teria de estar ligado 24 horas por dia. Este sistema é geralmente usado em maior escala por empresas privadas, que oferecem os famosos serviços de alojamento de sites. São essencialmente um grande número de máquinas que fornecem o serviço que descrevemos, mas desta vez não apenas para um site com alguns vídeos, mas para milhares de sites de todo o mundo.</p>
<p>Existem empresas muito maiores que oferecem mais potência e serviços. Hoje em dia, até se montam servidores exclusivamente para atender às demandas de serviços de inteligência artificial.</p>
<h3 id="o-fediverso">O Fediverso<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#o-fediverso">#</a></h3>
<p>Agora que temos uma ideia geral de como um servidor funciona, vamos falar sobre o Fediverso.
O Fediverso é um ecossistema de aplicações que, por sua vez, têm canais, chamados instâncias. A atividade de cada instância é alojada num servidor que é administrado por uma comunidade, uma pessoa ou uma empresa privada. Pode-se dizer que é semelhante ao Discord, onde se aluga um servidor para a sua comunidade. Mas há uma diferença: todos esses servidores pertencem à empresa Discord, enquanto no Fediverso tudo é independente.</p>
<p>No Fediverso, existem aplicações como o Mastodon, que é semelhante ao X (antigo Twitter), com canais ou instâncias independentes, cada um com os seus próprios servidores e administradores. Ao contrário do Twitter, onde tudo acaba nos servidores de Elon Musk, no Mastodon os dados podem permanecer no servidor dessa instância específica ou ser partilhados com outras instâncias noutros servidores. Isto depende de os administradores terem decidido formar uma comunidade de canais onde os dados são partilhados. Esta atividade chama-se federação.</p>
<p>A capacidade de federar existe graças a um protocolo de dados inovador chamado ActivityPub. Para dar um exemplo prático: imagine que o YouTube e o TikTok eram federados. Você &ldquo;gosta&rdquo; de um vídeo no YouTube, e esse utilizador receberia a notificação no TikTok. Poderia seguir alguém do TikTok a partir da sua conta do YouTube. Nas plataformas atuais, isso não acontece porque são sistemas fechados. O YouTube e o TikTok não podem federar porque não usam o ActivityPub.</p>
<p>E isto não é ficção científica: no Fediverso, ISTO JÁ funciona. Pode seguir um criador de vídeos no PeerTube a partir da sua conta Mastodon, ou comentar um podcast no Castopod sem sair da sua aplicação. É como viver num bairro onde todas as casas têm portas que se abrem umas para as outras, em vez de estarem todos trancados nos seus bunkers.</p>
<p>Dentro do Fediverso, não existe apenas o Mastodon. Existem também aplicações dedicadas a vídeos, podcasts, etc., e todas elas podem federar entre si porque usam o protocolo ActivityPub. Existe o PeerTube para vídeos e o Castopod para podcasts.</p>
<h3 id="o-futuro-do-fediverso">O Futuro do Fediverso<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#o-futuro-do-fediverso">#</a></h3>
<p>O Fediverso foi construído para combater os monopólios de grandes empresas como a Google, a Microsoft e a Apple. No entanto, existem muitos desafios pela frente, e eu identifiquei alguns problemas.</p>
<p>Por um lado, embora tudo pareça aberto e descentralizado, muitas instâncias permanecem fechadas. Existem comunidades fechadas que não se abrem à comunidade em geral. Este elitismo digital manifesta-se nos chamados &ldquo;gatekeepers&rdquo;: administradores que decidem unilateralmente quais instâncias merecem federar com a sua, quem pode entrar na sua comunidade ou que conteúdos são &ldquo;dignos&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Existem instâncias que exigem &ldquo;cartas de apresentação&rdquo;, como se fossem clubes exclusivos. Outras bloqueiam instâncias inteiras por pequenas diferenças ideológicas, fragmentando ainda mais o ecossistema. Ironicamente, o Fediverso promete libertar-nos dos algoritmos de Zuckerberg e Musk, mas agora temos centenas de pequenos Zuckerbergs com os seus próprios reinos digitais.</p>
<p>Por outro lado, notei no Mastodon uma síndrome que também pode ser detetada numa aplicação fechada como o Substack. No Substack, reparei que toda a gente escreve, mas ninguém lê os outros. E se leem, não comentam. Fica-se com a sensação de que as pessoas leem o que escrevemos, mas seguem em frente. Sinto algo semelhante no Mastodon.</p>
<p>Provavelmente é porque recebemos tanta informação, em tanta quantidade, e acredite, toda informação é valiosa. Recebemos tanta informação que não paramos para agradecer pelo que vemos, pelo que lemos, por aquela mensagem que nos é enviada do outro lado. E se isso ajuda em alguma coisa, a dar valor a tudo o que nos chega, vamos aprender a ler nas entrelinhas, a entender o que aquele texto ou bilhete realmente nos diz, mesmo que pareça banal ou trivial.</p>
<p>Vamos inverter o contexto. Passamos muito tempo offline e longe de tudo. Vamos imaginar que estamos em um mundo completamente estranho à nossa sociedade, vamos imaginar que estamos no planeta Marte. E acontece que recebemos uma mensagem, ou um Toot, como os chamam no Mastodon. Imagine o quão valioso esse Toot será para nós. Seja um vídeo, um áudio ou uma frase simples, ele faz você sentir que não está sozinho e que há alguém do outro lado. Nós o consideraríamos muito mais valioso, justamente porque aquele Toot chegou em um momento de solidão e necessidade e, portanto, precisávamos dele. Por isso, é importante nos posicionarmos sob essa perspectiva para valorizar tudo o que chega, mesmo que a intenção do outro lado seja diferente.</p>
<p>Finalmente, surge uma pergunta incômoda: se o Fediverse reproduz a mesma dinâmica de poder que critica, não seria simplesmente feudalismo digital com melhor marketing? Ou ainda há esperança de que a descentralização cumpra sua promessa original?</p>

<p>फेडिवर्स को समझने के लिए, हमें पहले यह समझना होगा कि सर्वर क्या है। आपका सर्वर एक राउटर की तरह होता है; इसमें काम करने के लिए इनपुट और आउटपुट होते हैं। यदि आप अपने कंप्यूटर को एक निश्चित तरीके से कॉन्फ़िगर करते हैं तो वह एक सर्वर हो सकता है। कल्पना कीजिए कि आपके पास साझा करने के लिए वीडियो हैं और आप इसे अपने घर से करना चाहते हैं। यदि आपका कंप्यूटर अब एक सर्वर है, तो आप उन वीडियो को अपने घर से साझा कर सकते हैं। आपको वर्डप्रेस जैसे सॉफ़्टवेयर का उपयोग करके किसी अन्य कंप्यूटर के साथ एक वेबसाइट बनानी होगी और उसे अपने कंप्यूटर-सर्वर से जोड़ना होगा। इस प्रणाली के साथ, आम जनता उस वेबसाइट पर जाएगी, आपके वीडियो के थंबनेल देखेगी, क्लिक करेगी, और वहां से सिग्नल आपके कंप्यूटर-सर्वर को भेजा जाएगा। यह उस अनुरोध को एक इनपुट के रूप में प्राप्त करता है और, एक आउटपुट के रूप में, आपके वीडियो के सिग्नल को वेब पर भेजता है ताकि जनता उसे देख सके। बैंडविड्थ के आधार पर, 5G जैसी तकनीकी प्रगति के कारण इसमें मिलीसेकंड लग सकते हैं। मोटे तौर पर, यह एक सर्वर है: यह वीडियो, ऑडियो और सभी प्रकार के डेटा जैसी सामग्री के लिए इनपुट और आउटपुट की सेवा प्रदान करता है।</p>
<p>यह एक व्यक्तिगत सर्वर का एक उदाहरण है, जिसे तार्किक रूप से किसी भी समय अनुरोधों का जवाब देने के लिए 24/7 चालू रहने की आवश्यकता होगी। यह प्रणाली आम तौर पर निजी कंपनियों द्वारा बड़े पैमाने पर उपयोग की जाती है, जो प्रसिद्ध वेब होस्टिंग सेवाएं प्रदान करती हैं। ये अनिवार्य रूप से बड़ी संख्या में मशीनें हैं जो हमारे द्वारा वर्णित सेवा प्रदान कर रही हैं, लेकिन इस बार केवल कुछ वीडियो वाली एक वेबसाइट के लिए नहीं, बल्कि दुनिया भर की हजारों वेबसाइटों के लिए।
ऐसी बहुत बड़ी कंपनियाँ हैं जो अधिक शक्ति और सेवाएँ प्रदान करती हैं। आज, सर्वर केवल कृत्रिम बुद्धिमत्ता सेवाओं की मांगों को संभालने के लिए भी स्थापित किए जाते हैं।</p>
<h3 id="फडवरस-the-fediverse">फेडिवर्स (The Fediverse)<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#फडवरस-the-fediverse">#</a></h3>
<p>अब जब हमें एक सामान्य विचार है कि एक सर्वर कैसे काम करता है, तो चलिए फेडिवर्स के बारे में बात करते हैं।
फेडिवर्स अनुप्रयोगों का एक पारिस्थितिकी तंत्र है, जिसमें बदले में चैनल होते हैं, जिन्हें इंस्टेंस (instances) कहा जाता है। प्रत्येक इंस्टेंस की गतिविधि एक सर्वर पर होस्ट की जाती है जिसे एक समुदाय, एक व्यक्ति या एक निजी कंपनी द्वारा प्रशासित किया जाता है। आप कह सकते हैं कि यह डिस्कॉर्ड के समान है, जहाँ आप अपने समुदाय की मेजबानी के लिए एक सर्वर किराए पर लेते हैं। लेकिन एक अंतर है: वे सभी सर्वर डिस्कॉर्ड कंपनी के हैं, जबकि फेडिवर्स में, सब कुछ स्वतंत्र है।
फेडिवर्स में, आपके पास मैस्टोडॉन जैसे एप्लिकेशन हैं, जो एक्स (पूर्व में ट्विटर) के समान है, जिसमें स्वतंत्र चैनल या इंस्टेंस होते हैं, प्रत्येक के अपने सर्वर और प्रशासक होते हैं। ट्विटर के विपरीत, जहां सब कुछ एलोन मस्क के सर्वर पर समाप्त होता है, मैस्टोडॉन में डेटा उस विशिष्ट इंस्टेंस के सर्वर पर रह सकता है या अन्य सर्वर पर अन्य इंस्टेंस के साथ साझा किया जा सकता है। यह इस बात पर निर्भर करता है कि क्या प्रशासकों ने चैनलों का एक समुदाय बनाने का फैसला किया है जहां डेटा साझा किया जाता है। इस गतिविधि को संघ (federation) कहा जाता है।</p>
<p>संघ की क्षमता ActivityPub नामक एक अभिनव डेटा प्रोटोकॉल के कारण मौजूद है। आपको एक व्यावहारिक उदाहरण देने के लिए: कल्पना कीजिए कि यूट्यूब और टिकटॉक संघबद्ध थे। आप यूट्यूब पर एक वीडियो को &ldquo;लाइक&rdquo; करते हैं, और उस उपयोगकर्ता को टिकटॉक के भीतर अधिसूचना प्राप्त होगी। आप अपने यूट्यूब खाते से टिकटॉक पर किसी का अनुसरण कर सकते हैं। आज के प्लेटफार्मों में, ऐसा नहीं होता है क्योंकि वे बंद सिस्टम हैं। यूट्यूब और टिकटॉक संघबद्ध नहीं हो सकते क्योंकि वे एक्टिविटीपब का उपयोग नहीं करते हैं।</p>
<p>और यह विज्ञान कथा नहीं है: फेडिवर्स में, यह पहले से ही काम करता है। आप अपने मैस्टोडॉन खाते से पीयरट्यूब पर एक वीडियो निर्माता का अनुसरण कर सकते हैं, या अपने पसंदीदा ऐप को छोड़े बिना कास्टोपॉड पर एक पॉडकास्ट पर टिप्पणी कर सकते हैं। यह एक ऐसे पड़ोस में रहने जैसा है जहाँ सभी घरों के दरवाजे एक-दूसरे के लिए खुले हैं, बजाय इसके कि हर कोई अपने बंकर में बंद हो।</p>
<p>फेडिवर्स के भीतर, केवल मैस्टोडॉन ही नहीं है। वीडियो, पॉडकास्ट आदि के लिए समर्पित एप्लिकेशन भी हैं, और वे सभी एक-दूसरे के साथ संघबद्ध हो सकते हैं क्योंकि वे एक्टिविटीपब प्रोटोकॉल का उपयोग करते हैं। वीडियो के लिए पीयरट्यूब और पॉडकास्ट के लिए कास्टोपॉड है।</p>
<h3 id="फडवरस-क-भवषय-the-future-of-the-fediverse">फेडिवर्स का भविष्य (The Future of the Fediverse)<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#फडवरस-क-भवषय-the-future-of-the-fediverse">#</a></h3>
<p>फेडिवर्स का निर्माण गूगल, माइक्रोसॉफ्ट और एप्पल जैसी बड़ी कंपनियों के एकाधिकार से निपटने के लिए किया गया था। हालाँकि, आगे कई चुनौतियाँ हैं, और मैंने कुछ समस्याओं की पहचान की है।</p>
<p>एक ओर, जबकि सब कुछ खुला और विकेंद्रीकृत लगता है, कई इंस्टेंस बंद रहते हैं। ऐसे बंद समुदाय हैं जो आम समुदाय के लिए नहीं खुलते हैं। यह डिजिटल अभिजात्यवाद तथाकथित &ldquo;द्वारपालकों&rdquo; (gatekeepers) में प्रकट होता है: प्रशासक जो एकतरफा निर्णय लेते हैं कि कौन से इंस्टेंस उनके साथ संघबद्ध होने के योग्य हैं, कौन उनके समुदाय में शामिल हो सकता है, या कौन सी सामग्री &ldquo;योग्य&rdquo; है।</p>
<p>ऐसे इंस्टेंस हैं जिनमें शामिल होने के लिए &ldquo;परिचय पत्र&rdquo; की आवश्यकता होती है, जैसे कि वे विशेष क्लब हों। अन्य मामूली वैचारिक मतभेदों पर पूरे इंस्टेंस को ब्लॉक कर देते हैं, जिससे पारिस्थितिकी तंत्र और भी खंडित हो जाता है। विडंबना यह है कि फेडिवर्स हमें ज़करबर्ग और मस्क के एल्गोरिदम से मुक्त करने का वादा करता है, लेकिन अब हमारे पास अपने स्वयं के डिजिटल राज्यों के साथ सैकड़ों छोटे ज़करबर्ग हैं।</p>
<p>दूसरी ओर, मैंने मैस्टोडॉन में एक सिंड्रोम देखा है जो सबस्टैक जैसे बंद एप्लिकेशन में भी देखा जा सकता है। सबस्टैक पर, मैंने पाया कि हर कोई लिखता है, लेकिन कोई भी दूसरों को नहीं पढ़ता है। और अगर वे पढ़ते हैं, तो वे टिप्पणी नहीं करते हैं। आपको यह महसूस होता है कि लोग आपको पढ़ते हैं लेकिन आगे बढ़ जाते हैं। मुझे मैस्टोडॉन में कुछ ऐसा ही महसूस होता है।</p>
<p>ऐसा शायद इसलिए है क्योंकि हमें इतनी सारी जानकारी, इतनी मात्रा में मिलती है, और यकीन मानिए, सारी जानकारी मूल्यवान होती है। हमें इतनी सारी जानकारी मिलती है कि हम जो देखते हैं, जो पढ़ते हैं, उस संदेश के लिए जो दूसरी तरफ से हमें भेजा जाता है, उसके लिए कृतज्ञता व्यक्त करना नहीं छोड़ते। और अगर यह हमारे सामने आने वाली हर चीज़ को महत्व देने में ज़रा भी मदद करता है, तो आइए पंक्तियों के बीच पढ़ना सीखें, यह समझें कि वह पाठ या नोट असल में हमें क्या बता रहा है, भले ही वह साधारण या मामूली लगे।</p>
<p>आइए संदर्भ को उलट दें। हम बहुत सारा समय ऑफ़लाइन और हर चीज़ से दूर बिताते हैं। मान लीजिए कि हम एक ऐसी दुनिया में हैं जो हमारे समाज से बिल्कुल अलग है, मान लीजिए कि हम मंगल ग्रह पर हैं। और पता चलता है कि हमें एक संदेश, या एक टूट, जैसा कि मैस्टोडॉन पर कहा जाता है, प्राप्त होता है। सोचिए कि वह टूट हमारे लिए कितना मूल्यवान होगा। चाहे वह वीडियो हो, ऑडियो हो, या कोई साधारण वाक्यांश हो, यह आपको ऐसा एहसास दिलाता है कि आप अकेले नहीं हैं और दूसरी तरफ कोई है। हम इसे कहीं ज़्यादा मूल्यवान मानेंगे, क्योंकि वह टूट अकेलेपन और ज़रूरत के समय आया था, और इसलिए, हमें इसकी ज़रूरत थी। इसलिए ज़रूरी है कि हम इस नज़रिए से खुद को स्थापित करें और आने वाली हर चीज़ का मूल्यांकन करें, भले ही दूसरी तरफ़ का इरादा अलग हो।</p>
<p>अंत में, एक असहज सवाल उठता है: अगर फेडिवर्स उसी शक्ति-गतिकी को दोहराता है जिसकी वह आलोचना करता है, तो क्या यह सिर्फ़ बेहतर मार्केटिंग वाला डिजिटल सामंतवाद नहीं है? या क्या विकेंद्रीकरण के अपने मूल वादे को पूरा करने की अभी भी उम्मीद है?</p>
